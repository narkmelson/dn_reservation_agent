This means that we subject our stomachs and social lives to the good, the bad, and more often than not, the perfectly fine. And every once in a while, a new spot makes us feel like Kamala Harris at a pantsuit sale. When that happens, we add it here, to The Hit List.\n\nThe Hit List is where you\u2019ll find all of the best new restaurants in DC**.** As long as it opened within the past several months and we\u2019re still talking about it, it\u2019s on this guide.The latest addition might be a buzzy new restaurant with caviar priced by the bump. Or it might be an under-the-radar lunch counter where a few dollars will get something that\u2019ll rattle around in your brain like a loose penny in a dryer.\n\nKeep tabs on the Hit List and you will always know just which new restaurants you should be eating at right now.\n\n**New to the Hit List (12/11): Eunoia**\n\n###### What Our Ratings Mean\n\n[Learn more](/ratings-explainer)\n\nNONE\n\n1-5\n\n6s\n\n7s\n\n8s\n\n9s\n\nUnrated: This is a restaurant we want to re-visit before rating, or it\u2019s a coffee shop, bar, or dessert shop.

The menu, which leans heavily into Mexican cuisine (tacos and mole are stars), steers without warning into Bulgarian and Japanese flavors, with some phyllo dough here and some miso paste there. The upscale [Union Market](https://www.theinfatuation.com/washington-dc/guides/best-dishes-union-market) space seems to be more straightforward, playing into the industrial-chic nature of the building, with high ceilings, glass walls, and exposed pipes. But then, as if taking a cue from the menu, the unexpected comes into view: Eunoia isn\u2019t just a restaurant, it\u2019s also a Pilates studio. It is, admittedly, a bit weird. But the food\u2014the improbable mashup of three unrelated cuisines\u2014lands. So much so that we\u2019re willing to look past the bare feet crossing our sightline mid-bite.\n\n[RESERVE A TABLE](https://resy.com/cities/washington-dc/venues/eunoia-restaurant)\n\nEunoia\n\n[## Eebee\u2019s Corner Bar](/washington-dc/reviews/eebees-corner-bar)\n\n[1840 Sixth St NW, Washington, District of Columbia 20001](https://www.google.com/maps/search/?api=1&query=Eebee%E2%80%99s%20Corner%20Bar+1840 Sixth St NW, Washington, District of Columbia 20001)\n\n$$$$\n\n[American](/washington-dc/cuisines/american)\n\n[Shaw](/washington-dc/neighborhoods/shaw)\n\nPerfect For:[Drinking Great Cocktails](/washington-dc/perfect-for/drinking-great-cocktails)[Night On The Town](/washington-dc/perfect-for/night-on-the-town)[Late Nights](/washington-dc/perfect-for/late-nights)[Casual Dinners](/washington-dc/perfect-for/casual-dinners)\n\nThe debut venture from the beer director behind [Green Zone](https://www.theinfatuation.com/washington-dc/reviews/the-green-zone) and the ever-expanding Andy\u2019s Pizza empire, Eebee\u2019s caters to off-shift industry workers with a kitchen that\u2019s open until 2am. It's a bar first and foremost, but the food is no afterthought. Options include a turkey club, shrimp cocktail, and some of the best mozzarella sticks we\u2019ve ever had, thinly breaded with almost no grease. There\u2019s also a $25 burger with a perfectly seasoned, nearly two-inch-thick patty. The place hits capacity early and stays that way through most weekend nights, but even on school nights most bar seats are filled by off-shift hospitality workers. Order a martini and the onion rings or club sandwich and strike up a conversation with a stranger. If they end up becoming your emergency contact, nobody will be surprised\u2014this place was designed for a meet-cute.\n\nThomas Rose\n\n[## Maison Bar \u00c0 Vins](/washington-dc/reviews/maison-bar-a-vins)\n\n[1834 Columbia Rd NW, Washington, District of Columbia 20009](https://www.google.com/maps/search/?api=1&query=Maison%20Bar%20%C3%80%20Vins+1834 Columbia Rd NW, Washington, District of Columbia 20009)\n\n$$$$\n\n[Wine Bar](/washington-dc/cuisines/wine-bar)\n\n[Adams Morgan](/washington-dc/neighborhoods/adams-morgan)\n\nPerfect For:[Late Nights](/washington-dc/perfect-for/late-nights)[Date Nights](/washington-dc/perfect-for/date-night)[Impressing Out of Towners](/washington-dc/perfect-for/impressing-out-of-towners)[Drinking Great Wine](/washington-dc/perfect-for/drinking-great-wine)[Drinks & A Light Bite](/washington-dc/perfect-for/drinks-a-light-bite)\n\nThe latest jewel box of a restaurant from the team behind [Lut\u00e9ce](https://www.theinfatuation.com/washington-dc/reviews/lutece) and [Pascual](https://www.theinfatuation.com/washington-dc/reviews/pascual)\u2014people who seem constitutionally incapable of getting it wrong\u2014sits in a former [Adams Morgan](https://www.theinfatuation.com/washington-dc/guides/best-restaurants-bars-adams-morgan-dc) row home that spent three decades as the Cuban nightclub Habana Village. Anyone who appreciates Lut\u00e8ce and Pascal\u2019s penchant for biodynamic wines will find plenty to love here, with a list that runs over a thousand vintages long. But while Maison Bar \u00e0 Vins bills itself as a wine bar, the food alone is worth a visit. The smoked eel croquettes, exceptionally creamy and topped with a thin sliver of singed eel, are a standout. For something more substantial, the brioche stuffed chicken is theoretically big enough to share, but the crunchy brioche and buttery chanterelle mushrooms could turn the most communal-minded diner into a food hoarder.\n\n[RESERVE A TABLE](https://resy.com/cities/washington-dc/venues/maison)\n\nDeb Lindsey\n\n[## (H)ours At Manifest 002](/washington-dc/reviews/manifest-002)\n\n[1242 Third St NE, Washington, District of Columbia 20002](https://www.google.com/maps/search/?api=1&query=(H)ours%20At%20Manifest%20002+1242 Third St NE, Washington, District of Columbia 20002)\n\n$$$$\n\n[Fusion](/washington-dc/cuisines/fusion)\n\n[Union Market](/washington-dc/neighborhoods/union-market)\n\nPerfect For:[Date Nights](/washington-dc/perfect-for/date-night)[Impressing Out of Towners](/washington-dc/perfect-for/impressing-out-of-towners)[First Dates](/washington-dc/perfect-for/first-dates)[See & Be Seen](/washington-dc/perfect-for/see-and-be-seen)[Drinking Great Cocktails](/washington-dc/perfect-for/drinking-great-cocktails)\n\n(H)ours At Manifest 002 bucks DC stereotypes. Instead of cold concrete and brutalist angles, its lilac cushions and soft edges. Instead of imported politicians in poorly tailored suits, it\u2019s homegrown hustlers in Margiela jackets. And instead of traditional steakhouse fare, it\u2019s contemporary soul food fused with flavors from around the world. The restaurant is attached to a members club that also includes a barber shop, cafe, retail store, and more. Just like the building it\u2019s in, the food here isn\u2019t content to be simply one thing. Butter for the bread is also a lit candle. Signature cocktails include an aromatic bowl of tea. And the dishes pair flavors from opposite sides of the globe. At (H)ours, tuna crudo meets chow-chow and bolognese shakes hands with Ethiopian spice.\n\n[RESERVE A TABLE](https://www.sevenrooms.com/explore/menifest/reservations/create/search/)\n\nVina Sananikone\n\n[## Karravaan](/washington-dc/reviews/karravaan)\n\n[325 Morse St NE, Washington, District of Columbia 20002](https://www.google.com/maps/search/?api=1&query=Karravaan+325 Morse St NE, Washington, District of Columbia 20002)\n\n$$$$\n\n[Fusion](/washington-dc/cuisines/fusion)\n\n[Union Market](/washington-dc/neighborhoods/union-market)\n\nPerfect For:[Date Nights](/washington-dc/perfect-for/date-night)[Drinking Great Cocktails](/washington-dc/perfect-for/drinking-great-cocktails)[Night On The Town](/washington-dc/perfect-for/night-on-the-town)[Special Occasions](/washington-dc/perfect-for/special-occasions)\n\nKarravaan in [Union Market](https://www.theinfatuation.com/washington-dc/guides/best-dishes-union-market) feels like it\u2019s been here for a hundred years. The restaurant channels the sleek glamor of a 1920s Beirut caf\u00e9 crossed with a waiting room for the Orient Express, with tiled floors, bentwood chairs, an oversized clock, and a wall of windows that seems perfect for watching an approaching train. That mishmash of design choices makes sense in a restaurant whose menu traces the Silk Road, serving up dishes like falafel topped with slivered ginger, khachapuri filled with steaming goat feta, and lamb sliders with sumac and jalapenos. Za\u2019atar fries are a natural companion, as are the cocktails, like the mezcal and p\u00e9t-nat Bedouin Sunset, which is mixed with lime bitters and blood orange syrup.\n\n[RESERVE A TABLE](https://resy.com/cities/washington-dc/venues/karravaan)\n\nBirch Thomas\n\n[## Sushi Gaku](/washington-dc/reviews/sushi-gaku)\n\n[1338 Wisconsin Ave NW, Washington, District of Columbia 20007](https://www.google.com/maps/search/?api=1&query=Sushi%20Gaku+1338 Wisconsin Ave NW, Washington, District of Columbia 20007)\n\n$$$$\n\n[Japanese](/washington-dc/cuisines/japanese)\n\n[Georgetown](/washington-dc/neighborhoods/georgetown)\n\nPerfect For:[Birthdays](/washington-dc/perfect-for/birthdays)[Corporate Cards](/washington-dc/perfect-for/corporate-cards)[Date Nights](/washington-dc/perfect-for/date-night)[Special Occasions](/washington-dc/perfect-for/special-occasions)\n\nA downtown DC favorite until it closed in late 2024,\u00a0Sushi Gaku\u00a0has resurfaced in [Georgetown](https://www.theinfatuation.com/washington-dc/guides/georgetown-restaurants) with a new address and a new look. Yes, you can still splurge on the $180 omakase, but the \u00e0 la carte menu makes it just as easy to have a good time. The lightly spicy tuna roll has just enough crunch, while the eel nigiri is good enough to tempt an all-eel order (a true chaos move, but do you). Set in a quiet basement with a dining room that opens onto a courtyard filled with bistro tables, the vibe at Sushi Gaku exists somewhere between private club and cozy hangout, and is as suited to last-minute business dinners on the corporate card as it is a low-key date night.\n\n[RESERVE A TABLE](https://tables.toasttab.com/restaurants/da52ffef-cb4b-43ea-b624-7ae24714ecc2/reserve)\n\nSushi Gaku\n\n[## Cafe Fiorello](/washington-dc/reviews/cafe-fiorello-dc)\n\n[1001 Pennsylvania Ave NW, Washington, District of Columbia 20004](https://www.google.com/maps/search/?api=1&query=Cafe%20Fiorello+1001 Pennsylvania Ave NW, Washington, District of Columbia 20004)\n\n$$$$\n\n[Italian](/washington-dc/cuisines/italian)\n\n[Downtown](/washington-dc/neighborhoods/downtown)\n\nPerfect For:[Date Nights](/washington-dc/perfect-for/date-night)[Casual Dinners](/washington-dc/perfect-for/casual-dinners)\n\nThe first thing you should do at Caf\u00e9 Fiorello is order a martini. Not only will it be perfectly chilled and shaken with just enough olive brine to keep things interesting, but it will arrive at your table on a silver tray and delicately placed on the white tablecloth by a server who seems like they\u2019ve been training their whole life for this moment. The Italian American restaurant has been a [New York City institution](https://www.theinfatuation.com/new-york/reviews/cafe-fiorello) since 1974, and the DC outpost has captured the spirit of the original.\u00a0It\u2019s easy to get swept up in the beauty of Fiorello\u2019s pastas (their peppery spaghetti carbonara is shockingly rich, and exactly what we crave on a cold evening). But the eggplant parmesan is the star of the menu. Their version takes up an entire dinner plate, and while this is a dish that usually makes us want to go take a nap, Fiorello\u2019s version is lighter thanks to the fact that the eggplant is baked rather than breaded and fried.\n\n[RESERVE A TABLE](https://www.opentable.com/r/cafe-fiorello-dc-washington?ref=16825)\n\n[## My Little Chamomile](/washington-dc/reviews/my-little-chamomile)\n\n[3210 Cherry Hill Ln NW, Washington, District of Columbia 20007](https://www.google.com/maps/search/?api=1&query=My%20Little%20Chamomile%20+3210 Cherry Hill Ln NW, Washington, District of Columbia 20007)\n\n$$$$\n\n[Turkish](/washington-dc/cuisines/turkish)\n\n[Georgetown](/washington-dc/neighborhoods/georgetown)\n\nPerfect For:[Casual Dinners](/washington-dc/perfect-for/casual-dinners)[Date Nights](/washington-dc/perfect-for/date-night)\n\nMy Little Chamomile is a Turkish restaurant from the team behind [Green Almond Pantry](https://www.theinfatuation.com/washington-dc/reviews/green-almond-pantry). Tucked down a quaint [Georgetown](https://www.theinfatuation.com/washington-dc/guides/georgetown-restaurants) alley, the quiet dining room is a place you can bring your parents, your professor, or anyone you need to whisper a secret to without having to shout across the table. The vegetable-forward menu works best shared, and the smallish portions make it easy to skip around. If tomatoes are still in season, start with the super fresh coban salatas\u0131. Otherwise, the\u00a0girit ezmesi, an overload of feta, labneh, and goat cheese whipped together and dusted with pistachios, or the dedemin biberi, anaheim peppers marinated in vinegar and garlic with just enough kick to make them interesting, both make great ice breakers. For something more substantial, we love the mant\u0131 beef dumplings with yogurt. Finish with chamomile tea (naturally) and the\u00a0tel kaday\u0131f, a dessert that recalls baklava but uses shredded phyllo.\n\n[RESERVE A TABLE](https://www.opentable.com/r/my-little-chamomile-washington-dc?ref=16825)\n\nSam Vasfi\n\n[## Fish Shop](/washington-dc/reviews/fish-shop-dc)\n\n[610 Water St SW, Washington DC, District of Columbia 20024](https://www.google.com/maps/search/?api=1&query=Fish%20Shop+610 Water St SW, Washington DC, District of Columbia 20024)\n\n$$$$\n\n[Seafood](/washington-dc/cuisines/seafood)\n\n[Wharf](/washington-dc/neighborhoods/wharf)\n\nPerfect For:[Date Nights](/washington-dc/perfect-for/date-night)[Impressing Out of Towners](/washington-dc/perfect-for/impressing-out-of-towners)\n\nWe\u2019re a little confused as to why the second location of Fish Shop opened in DC (the original is in the Scottish countryside town of Ballater, pop. 1400) but we\u2019re not complaining. Opened by the folks at Artfarm, the hospitality arm of the global gallery Hauser & Wirth, the sweeping 180-seat seafood spot takes some inspiration from the gallery, with a massive installation of floating fish sculpted from North Carolina wisteria and Scottish willow. While Fish Shop's roots are Scottish, its menu is decidedly mid-Atlantic, built around what\u2019s fresh from the Chesapeake Bay, Rappahannock River, Atlantic Ocean, and local farms. Think small bites like Maryland crab crumpets and New Jersey squid, as well as hearty mains like Maryland blue crab conchiglie and grilled New Jersey mackerel. For desert, try the tiramisu made with candied Virginia peanuts.\n\nDave Watts\n\n[## Chai Pani](/washington-dc/reviews/chai-pani-dc)\n\n[1325 5th St NE, Washington, DC 20002](https://www.google.com/maps/search/?api=1&query=Chai%20Pani+1325 5th St NE, Washington, DC 20002)\n\n$$$$\n\n[Indian](/washington-dc/cuisines/indian)\n\n[Union Market](/washington-dc/neighborhoods/union-market)\n\nPerfect For:[Big Groups](/washington-dc/perfect-for/big-groups)[Lunch](/washington-dc/perfect-for/lunch)[Casual Dinners](/washington-dc/perfect-for/casual-dinners)\n\nThere is nothing subtle about Chai Pani in Union Market. The 4,000 square-foot space sits under a canopy of bright pink bougainvilleas and orange garlands, and a mini market complete with a photogenic pani puri cart sells spices, cookbooks, and other branded merch. But underneath the splashy space, Chai Pani is serving some of the best [Indian food](https://www.theinfatuation.com/washington-dc/guides/best-indian-restaurants-dc) in DC. You can go alone, but we wouldn\u2019t recommend it. Come with a crew and order a spread of chaat like the excellent kale pakora, with a batter so light and crispy you\u2019ll swear they found a way to deep-fry air, or the puri with potato, onion, and sweet yogurt. The Sloppy Jai, made with spiced lamb, green chutney, and sweet yogurt, is a staple of the restaurant's original location in [Asheville](https://www.theinfatuation.com/asheville/reviews/chai-pani-asheville), and it\u2019s served here as two small pav sliders, ideal for sharing. Chai Pani knows how to play the hits, too. The methi malai paneer is rich with cashew cream and cardamom, and a nice anchor for a lot of the small plates that should be flying around your table.\n\n[RESERVE A TABLE](https://www.opentable.com/r/chai-pani-washington-dc?ref=16825)\n\nJonathan Smith\n\n8.7\n\n[## Elmina](/washington-dc/reviews/elmina)\n\n[2208 14th St NW, Washington, District of Columbia 20009](https://www.google.com/maps/search/?api=1&query=Elmina+2208 14th St NW, Washington, District of Columbia 20009)\n\n$$$$\n\n[Ghanaian](/washington-dc/cuisines/ghanaian)\n\n[U Street](/washington-dc/neighborhoods/u-street)\n\nPerfect For:[Date Nights](/washington-dc/perfect-for/date-night)[Dinner with the Parents](/washington-dc/perfect-for/dinner-with-the-parents)[Impressing Out of Towners](/washington-dc/perfect-for/impressing-out-of-towners)[Special Occasions](/washington-dc/perfect-for/special-occasions)\n\nElmina is what happens when Ghanaian food shows up to DC\u2019s fine dining scene in its Sunday best. The $135 four-course tasting menu blends deep tradition with sharp technique: think scallop crudo with citrus and coconut, rich palm nut stew with shrimp and octopus, and a jollof duck pot dripping with smoky, pepper-laced shito. The obvious move at Elmina, from celebrity chef Eric Adjepong, is to come for a birthday, anniversary, or some other occasion that warrants a nice shirt and planning ahead. And while it\u2019s great for that, we also love to come here on a whim and sit at the bar for the more casual a la carte menu, where you can get bites like okra fries, octopus kebabs with a shito glaze, or a hamachi collar with plantain chips.\n\n[EXCLUSIVE RESERVATIONS](https://www.opentable.com/sapphire-reserve-exclusive-tables) AT THIS SPOT WITH\n\n[RESERVE A TABLE](https://www.opentable.com/r/elmina-washington?ref=16825)\n\nElmina\n\n[## Osteria Mozza](/washington-dc/reviews/osteria-mozza-dc)\n\n[3276 M St NW, Washington DC, 20007](https://www.google.com/maps/search/?api=1&query=Osteria%20Mozza+3276 M St NW, Washington DC, 20007)\n\n$$$$\n\n[Italian](/washington-dc/cuisines/italian)\n\n[Georgetown](/washington-dc/neighborhoods/georgetown)\n\nEighteen years after Nancy Silverton opened [Osteria Mozza](https://www.theinfatuation.com/los-angeles/reviews/osteria-mozza) in LA, the iconic Italian restaurant has arrived in [Georgetown](https://www.theinfatuation.com/washington-dc/guides/georgetown-restaurants). It doesn\u2019t matter why or when you find yourself underneath the dining room\u2019s soaring ceilings, eating at Osteria Mozza feels like an occasion. Start with the Focaccia di Recco. It\u2019s not an option so much as a necessity\u2014an ultra-thin, crispy, cheese-stuffed marvel finished with some of the best olive oil we\u2019ve ever tasted. The sea trout is pan-seared to crisp-skinned perfection, its buttery flesh offset by the acidity of braised red cabbage, earthy Roveja peas, and the surprising richness of hard-boiled eggs. But if we had to pick just one reason to visit Osteria Mozza, it would be the dessert menu. The tiramisu is outstanding, but playing favorites feels unfair. If you decided to skip dinner entirely and focus solely on desserts, we wouldn\u2019t judge you.

The midcentury menu revives dishes that haven\u2019t been on-trend since the Eisenhower administration, and does them so spectacularly you\u2019ll wonder how exactly they went out of style in the first place. You\u2019ll find the requisite raw bar with oysters and cold king crab legs, but also a nod to Soviet dining in the herring under a fur coat. There\u2019s caviar and crab cakes, of course, but also pigs in a blanket, made from Hebrew National hot dogs wrapped in the Occidental\u2019s soon-to-be-legendary biscuits.\u00a0The Occidental is a loving homage\u2014and an assertive return\u2014to power dining with a wink and a flourish, where you can eat like a Kennedy and drink like a Cold War diplomat.\n\n[RESERVE A TABLE](https://resy.com/cities/washington-dc/venues/the-occidental)\n\nBirch Thomas\n\n## Suggested Reading\n\n### [The Best Restaurants In Navy Yard](/washington-dc/guides/nats-park-navy-yard-restaurants-bars)\n\nThere are a lot of great places to eat and drink in Navy Yard.
