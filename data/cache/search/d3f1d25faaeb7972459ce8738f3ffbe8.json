Go forth and be a pioneer\u2014or just keep up with our [Hit List](https://www.theinfatuation.com/washington-dc/guides/best-new-washington-dc-restaurants-hit-list) to see which new restaurants we checked out and loved.\n\n###### What Our Ratings Mean\n\n[Learn more](/ratings-explainer)\n\nUnrated: This is a restaurant we want to re-visit before rating, or it\u2019s a coffee shop, bar, or dessert shop. We only rate spots where you can eat a full meal.\n\n## December\n\n[## Springbone Kitchen](/washington-dc/reviews/springbone-kitchen)\n\n[1426 Wisconsin Ave NW, Washington, District of Columbia 20007](https://www.google.com/maps/search/?api=1&query=Springbone%20Kitchen+1426 Wisconsin Ave NW, Washington, District of Columbia 20007)\n\n$$$$\n\nSpringbone Kitchen is a New York-based chain specializing in bone broths.

Now, it's taken over an auto shop on the campus where it serves thin-and-crispy Chicago tavern pizzas, homemade sodas, and other Midwestern snacks in a big indoor-outdoor space overlooking the Great Lawn.\n\n## November\n\n[## Gigi\u2019s Pasta](/washington-dc/reviews/gigis-pasta)\n\n[2000 Washington Pl NE, Washington, District of Columbia 20018](https://www.google.com/maps/search/?api=1&query=Gigi%E2%80%99s%20Pasta+2000 Washington Pl NE, Washington, District of Columbia 20018)\n\n$$$$\n\n[Foggy Bottom](/washington-dc/neighborhoods/foggy-bottom)\n\nDC, birthplace of Sweetgreen, loves a customizable bowl.

The menu, which leans heavily into Mexican cuisine (tacos and mole are stars), steers without warning into Bulgarian and Japanese flavors, with some phyllo dough here and some miso paste there. The upscale [Union Market](https://www.theinfatuation.com/washington-dc/guides/best-dishes-union-market) space seems to be more straightforward, playing into the industrial-chic nature of the building, with high ceilings, glass walls, and exposed pipes. But then, as if taking a cue from the menu, the unexpected comes into view: Eunoia isn\u2019t just a restaurant, it\u2019s also a Pilates studio. It is, admittedly, a bit weird. But the food\u2014the improbable mashup of three unrelated cuisines\u2014lands.

It's a bar first and foremost, but the food is no afterthought. Options include a turkey club, shrimp cocktail, and some of the best mozzarella sticks we\u2019ve ever had, thinly breaded with almost no grease. There\u2019s also a $25 burger with a perfectly seasoned, nearly two-inch-thick patty. The place hits capacity early and stays that way through most weekend nights, but even on school nights most bar seats are filled by off-shift hospitality workers.

But while Maison Bar \u00e0 Vins bills itself as a wine bar, the food alone is worth a visit. The smoked eel croquettes, exceptionally creamy and topped with a thin sliver of singed eel, are a standout. For something more substantial, the brioche stuffed chicken is theoretically big enough to share, but the crunchy brioche and buttery chanterelle mushrooms could turn the most communal-minded diner into a food hoarder.\n\n[RESERVE A TABLE](https://resy.com/cities/washington-dc/venues/maison)\n\nDeb Lindsey\n\n[## (H)ours At Manifest 002](/washington-dc/reviews/manifest-002)\n\n[1242 Third St NE, Washington, District of Columbia 20002](https://www.google.com/maps/search/?api=1&query=(H)ours%20At%20Manifest%20002+1242 Third St NE, Washington, District of Columbia 20002)\n\n$$$$\n\n[Fusion](/washington-dc/cuisines/fusion)\n\n[Union Market](/washington-dc/neighborhoods/union-market)\n\nPerfect For:[Date Nights](/washington-dc/perfect-for/date-night)[Impressing Out of Towners](/washington-dc/perfect-for/impressing-out-of-towners)[First Dates](/washington-dc/perfect-for/first-dates)[See & Be Seen](/washington-dc/perfect-for/see-and-be-seen)[Drinking Great Cocktails](/washington-dc/perfect-for/drinking-great-cocktails)\n\n(H)ours At Manifest 002 bucks DC stereotypes.

The restaurant is attached to a members club that also includes a barber shop, cafe, retail store, and more. Just like the building it\u2019s in, the food here isn\u2019t content to be simply one thing. Butter for the bread is also a lit candle. Signature cocktails include an aromatic bowl of tea.

The restaurant channels the sleek glamor of a 1920s Beirut caf\u00e9 crossed with a waiting room for the Orient Express, with tiled floors, bentwood chairs, an oversized clock, and a wall of windows that seems perfect for watching an approaching train. That mishmash of design choices makes sense in a restaurant whose menu traces the Silk Road, serving up dishes like falafel topped with slivered ginger, khachapuri filled with steaming goat feta, and lamb sliders with sumac and jalapenos.

Yes, you can still splurge on the $180 omakase, but the \u00e0 la carte menu makes it just as easy to have a good time. The lightly spicy tuna roll has just enough crunch, while the eel nigiri is good enough to tempt an all-eel order (a true chaos move, but do you). Set in a quiet basement with a dining room that opens onto a courtyard filled with bistro tables, the vibe at Sushi Gaku exists somewhere between private club and cozy hangout, and is as suited to last-minute business dinners on the corporate card as it is a low-key date night.\n\n[RESERVE A TABLE](https://tables.toasttab.com/restaurants/da52ffef-cb4b-43ea-b624-7ae24714ecc2/reserve)\n\nSushi Gaku\n\n[## Cafe Fiorello](/washington-dc/reviews/cafe-fiorello-dc)\n\n[1001 Pennsylvania Ave NW, Washington, District of Columbia 20004](https://www.google.com/maps/search/?api=1&query=Cafe%20Fiorello+1001 Pennsylvania Ave NW, Washington, District of Columbia 20004)\n\n$$$$\n\n[Italian](/washington-dc/cuisines/italian)\n\n[Downtown](/washington-dc/neighborhoods/downtown)\n\nPerfect For:[Date Nights](/washington-dc/perfect-for/date-night)[Casual Dinners](/washington-dc/perfect-for/casual-dinners)\n\nThe first thing you should do at Caf\u00e9 Fiorello is order a martini. Not only will it be perfectly chilled and shaken with just enough olive brine to keep things interesting, but it will arrive at your table on a silver tray and delicately placed on the white tablecloth by a server who seems like they\u2019ve been training their whole life for this moment. The Italian American restaurant has been a [New York City institution](https://www.theinfatuation.com/new-york/reviews/cafe-fiorello) since 1974, and the DC outpost has captured the spirit of the original.\u00a0It\u2019s easy to get swept up in the beauty of Fiorello\u2019s pastas (their peppery spaghetti carbonara is shockingly rich, and exactly what we crave on a cold evening). But the eggplant parmesan is the star of the menu. Their version takes up an entire dinner plate, and while this is a dish that usually makes us want to go take a nap, Fiorello\u2019s version is lighter thanks to the fact that the eggplant is baked rather than breaded and fried.\n\n[RESERVE A TABLE](https://www.opentable.com/r/cafe-fiorello-dc-washington?ref=16825)\n\n[## My Little Chamomile](/washington-dc/reviews/my-little-chamomile)\n\n[3210 Cherry Hill Ln NW, Washington, District of Columbia 20007](https://www.google.com/maps/search/?api=1&query=My%20Little%20Chamomile%20+3210 Cherry Hill Ln NW, Washington, District of Columbia 20007)\n\n$$$$\n\n[Turkish](/washington-dc/cuisines/turkish)\n\n[Georgetown](/washington-dc/neighborhoods/georgetown)\n\nPerfect For:[Casual Dinners](/washington-dc/perfect-for/casual-dinners)[Date Nights](/washington-dc/perfect-for/date-night)\n\nMy Little Chamomile is a Turkish restaurant from the team behind [Green Almond Pantry](https://www.theinfatuation.com/washington-dc/reviews/green-almond-pantry).

The vegetable-forward menu works best shared, and the smallish portions make it easy to skip around. If tomatoes are still in season, start with the super fresh coban salatas\u0131. Otherwise, the\u00a0girit ezmesi, an overload of feta, labneh, and goat cheese whipped together and dusted with pistachios, or the dedemin biberi, anaheim peppers marinated in vinegar and garlic with just enough kick to make them interesting, both make great ice breakers. For something more substantial, we love the mant\u0131 beef dumplings with yogurt. Finish with chamomile tea (naturally) and the\u00a0tel kaday\u0131f, a dessert that recalls baklava but uses shredded phyllo.\n\n[RESERVE A TABLE](https://www.opentable.com/r/my-little-chamomile-washington-dc?ref=16825)\n\nSam Vasfi\n\n[## Fish Shop](/washington-dc/reviews/fish-shop-dc)\n\n[610 Water St SW, Washington DC, District of Columbia 20024](https://www.google.com/maps/search/?api=1&query=Fish%20Shop+610 Water St SW, Washington DC, District of Columbia 20024)\n\n$$$$\n\n[Seafood](/washington-dc/cuisines/seafood)\n\n[Wharf](/washington-dc/neighborhoods/wharf)\n\nPerfect For:[Date Nights](/washington-dc/perfect-for/date-night)[Impressing Out of Towners](/washington-dc/perfect-for/impressing-out-of-towners)\n\nWe\u2019re a little confused as to why the second location of Fish Shop opened in DC (the original is in the Scottish countryside town of Ballater, pop. 1400) but we\u2019re not complaining. Opened by the folks at Artfarm, the hospitality arm of the global gallery Hauser & Wirth, the sweeping 180-seat seafood spot takes some inspiration from the gallery, with a massive installation of floating fish sculpted from North Carolina wisteria and Scottish willow. While Fish Shop's roots are Scottish, its menu is decidedly mid-Atlantic, built around what\u2019s fresh from the Chesapeake Bay, Rappahannock River, Atlantic Ocean, and local farms. Think small bites like Maryland crab crumpets and New Jersey squid, as well as hearty mains like Maryland blue crab conchiglie and grilled New Jersey mackerel.

Come with a crew and order a spread of chaat like the excellent kale pakora, with a batter so light and crispy you\u2019ll swear they found a way to deep-fry air, or the puri with potato, onion, and sweet yogurt. The Sloppy Jai, made with spiced lamb, green chutney, and sweet yogurt, is a staple of the restaurant's original location in [Asheville](https://www.theinfatuation.com/asheville/reviews/chai-pani-asheville), and it\u2019s served here as two small pav sliders, ideal for sharing.

The $135 four-course tasting menu blends deep tradition with sharp technique: think scallop crudo with citrus and coconut, rich palm nut stew with shrimp and octopus, and a jollof duck pot dripping with smoky, pepper-laced shito. The obvious move at Elmina, from celebrity chef Eric Adjepong, is to come for a birthday, anniversary, or some other occasion that warrants a nice shirt and planning ahead. And while it\u2019s great for that, we also love to come here on a whim and sit at the bar for the more casual a la carte menu, where you can get bites like okra fries, octopus kebabs with a shito glaze, or a hamachi collar with plantain chips.\n\n[EXCLUSIVE RESERVATIONS](https://www.opentable.com/sapphire-reserve-exclusive-tables) AT THIS SPOT WITH\n\n[RESERVE A TABLE](https://www.opentable.com/r/elmina-washington?ref=16825)\n\nElmina\n\n[## Osteria Mozza](/washington-dc/reviews/osteria-mozza-dc)\n\n[3276 M St NW, Washington DC, 20007](https://www.google.com/maps/search/?api=1&query=Osteria%20Mozza+3276 M St NW, Washington DC, 20007)\n\n$$$$\n\n[Italian](/washington-dc/cuisines/italian)\n\n[Georgetown](/washington-dc/neighborhoods/georgetown)\n\nEighteen years after Nancy Silverton opened [Osteria Mozza](https://www.theinfatuation.com/los-angeles/reviews/osteria-mozza) in LA, the iconic Italian restaurant has arrived in [Georgetown](https://www.theinfatuation.com/washington-dc/guides/georgetown-restaurants).

And our food scene is laced with every bit of that culture, whether it\u2019s from down the block or halfway across the world. With so many choices, it can be overwhelming to decide where to eat after a day of exploring our [free museums](https://www.theinfatuation.com/washington-dc/guides/smithsonian-restaurants-dc-ranked) (seriously, y\u2019all pay for that in your city?). Here are a few great places to check out when you\u2019re in DC, even if you\u2019re only here for a day.\n\n###### What Our Ratings Mean\n\n[Learn more](/ratings-explainer)\n\nUnrated: This is a restaurant we want to re-visit before rating, or it\u2019s a coffee shop, bar, or dessert shop.

But it\u2019s the scallion-pancake egg sandwich that will turn anyone (including tourists here for more than a day) into a regular. It comes with your choice of bacon, kimchi, or sausage, and is served with a spicy, tangy garlic-chili oil. It's a great spot to work while you eat if you\u2019re in town on business, but is also a good choice for a family meal. Lounge on a green tweed couch if you're looking to kick back, or grab a more sturdy (but still comfortable) booth if you're there to grind.\n\n[RESERVE A TABLE](http://www.opentable.com/r/any-day-now-washington?ref=16825)\n\nNina Palazzolo\n\n8.0\n\n[## Kafe Leopold](/washington-dc/reviews/kafe-leopold)\n\n[3315 Cady's Alley, Washington, DC 20007](https://www.google.com/maps/search/?api=1&query=Kafe%20Leopold+3315 Cady's Alley, Washington, DC 20007)\n\n$$$$\n\n[European](/washington-dc/cuisines/european)\n\n[Georgetown](/washington-dc/neighborhoods/georgetown)\n\nPerfect For:[Casual Dinners](/washington-dc/perfect-for/casual-dinners)[Breakfast](/washington-dc/perfect-for/breakfast)[Brunch](/washington-dc/perfect-for/brunch)[Big Groups](/washington-dc/perfect-for/big-groups)[Sitting Outside](/washington-dc/perfect-for/sitting-outside)\n\nIt\u2019s easy to miss Kafe Leopold, tucked down Cady\u2019s Alley in Georgetown behind a barrage of interior design stores. In fact, you might mistake the Austrian restaurant for an outpost of Design Within Reach, with its sprawling dining room anchored in the middle by a bright orange Tatlin sofa. This is a utilitarian spot that\u2019s better than it needs to be, and the lengthy menu at the all-day cafe has options for whenever you might stop by. They're open from 8am until 10pm (and 11pm on Fridays and Saturdays), but we like it best for breakfast or brunch with a group where everyone can spread out in the sunny dining room. Try the salmon pizzette, served with horseradish creme and crispy radishes, or mix and match a trio of tea sandwiches with options like tomato and mozzarella, egg salad, and apple and cheese on a pretzel bun.\n\n[RESERVE A TABLE](https://resy.com/cities/washington-dc/venues/kafe-leopold)\n\nJonathan Smith\n\n7.7\n\n[## Florida Avenue Grill](/washington-dc/reviews/florida-avenue-grill)\n\n[1100 Florida Ave NW, Washington, D.C. 20009](https://www.google.com/maps/search/?api=1&query=Florida%20Avenue%20Grill+1100 Florida Ave NW, Washington, D.C. 20009)\n\n$$$$\n\n[Diner](/washington-dc/cuisines/diner)\n\n[Columbia Heights](/washington-dc/neighborhoods/columbia-heights)\n\nPerfect For:[Breakfast](/washington-dc/perfect-for/breakfast)[Classic Establishment](/washington-dc/perfect-for/classic-establishment)[Walk-Ins](/washington-dc/perfect-for/walk-ins)\n\nThe oldest [Black-owned](https://www.theinfatuation.com/washington-dc/guides/black-owned-restaurants-washington-dc) American restaurant in the city requires some planning if you want to taste their famous hot cakes, served with butter, cinnamon, and powdered sugar. After more than 70 years in business, the Shaw spot only opens Friday through Sunday from 9am-2pm. That makes it perfect if you\u2019re in town for the weekend, but block out a couple hours for your meal because things take time here. But as they say, good things come to those who wait, and the wait for dishes like the cajun fried catfish that have been perfected over the decades, is most definitely worth it..\n\nJai Williams\n\n7.8\n\n[## Yellow](/washington-dc/reviews/yellow)\n\n[1524 Wisconsin Ave NW, Washington, D.C. 20007](https://www.google.com/maps/search/?api=1&query=Yellow+1524 Wisconsin Ave NW, Washington, D.C. 20007)\n\n$$$$\n\n[Bakery/Cafe](/washington-dc/cuisines/bakerycafe)\n\n[Georgetown](/washington-dc/neighborhoods/georgetown)\n\nPerfect For:[Dining Solo](/washington-dc/perfect-for/dining-solo)[Brunch](/washington-dc/perfect-for/brunch)[Coffee & A Light Bite](/washington-dc/perfect-for/coffee-a-light-bite)[Drinks & A Light Bite](/washington-dc/perfect-for/drinks-a-light-bite)\n\nThis former Navy Yard caf\u00e9 was once next to its sister restaurant, [Albi](https://www.theinfatuation.com/washington-dc/reviews/albi), but has since found new life in both Georgetown and Union Market. We\u2019re partial to the Georgetown location for its shopping proximity, and the plush couches provide the perfect spot to people-watch or read the paperback you just picked up at Politics and Prose. Both caf\u00e9s have solid breakfast options that tend to sell out quickly, so the sooner you can scoot on in, the better. Our latest obsessions are the cardamom chocolate cruffin\u2014that\u2019s a combo we didn\u2019t know we needed\u2014and the super-stuffed BBQ cauliflower pita that\u2019s so huge, you could probably save half of it for a snack later.\n\nRey Lopez\n\n## LUNCH\n\n[## Maketto](/washington-dc/reviews/maketto)\n\n[1351 H St NE, Washington, D.C. 20002](https://www.google.com/maps/search/?api=1&query=Maketto+1351 H St NE, Washington, D.C. 20002)\n\n$$$$\n\n[Fusion](/washington-dc/cuisines/fusion)\n\n[H Street](/washington-dc/neighborhoods/h-street)\n\nPerfect For:[Casual Dinners](/washington-dc/perfect-for/casual-dinners)[Date Nights](/washington-dc/perfect-for/date-night)[Lunch](/washington-dc/perfect-for/lunch)[Coffee & A Light Bite](/washington-dc/perfect-for/coffee-a-light-bite)\n\nComme des Gar\u00e7ons Converse collabs, the third Tame Impala record, an issue of *Kinfolk*... At one point, you could purchase all these things at Maketto while eating a steamed bao. Today, it\u2019s shed most of its past as the first boutique clothing store/bistro mashup in DC. And that\u2019s a good thing, because what Maketto does best is serve excellent Taiwanese and Cambodian food. The lengthy menu features soft ball-sized pork baos, various dumplings, noodles, and Maketto\u2019s specialty, twice-fried chicken. It's open for dinner but is especially great during the daytime, when moms with strollers take away pandan lattes while 30-somethings in big coats and tiny beanies ride laptops and slurp lo mein.\n\nMelanie Landsman\n\n8.9\n\n[## Ben\u2019s Chili Bowl](/washington-dc/reviews/bens-chili-bowl)\n\n[1213 U St NW, Washington, D.C. 20009](https://www.google.com/maps/search/?api=1&query=Ben%E2%80%99s%20Chili%20Bowl+1213 U St NW, Washington, D.C. 20009)\n\n$$$$\n\n[Diner](/washington-dc/cuisines/diner)\n\n[U Street](/washington-dc/neighborhoods/u-street)\n\nPerfect For:[Classic Establishment](/washington-dc/perfect-for/classic-establishment)[Lunch](/washington-dc/perfect-for/lunch)[Casual Dinners](/washington-dc/perfect-for/casual-dinners)[Late Nights](/washington-dc/perfect-for/late-nights)\n\nBen\u2019s Chili Bowl put DC\u2019s infamous half-smoke on the map.

Taking cues from four regions telling vastly different stories about the African American experience, Sweet Home Caf\u00e9's menu changes frequently, but if the deservedly popular fried chicken is available, order it. With a crunchy seasoned breading that puts the Colonel\u2019s to shame, the meat is as succulent as a well-brined bird can be.For sides, the mac and cheese tastes like a recipe that\u2019s been proudly passed down through generations, and the humble potato salad, typically the least glamorous dish on any menu, is spectacular. Skip the banana pudding, which tastes heavily artificial, and go straight for the sweet potato pie, barely sweetened with just the right amount of spice.\n\nJosh Weilepp/NMAAHC\n\n## DINNER\n\n[## The Occidental](/washington-dc/reviews/the-occidental)\n\n[1475 Pennsylvania Ave NW, Washington, District of Columbia 20004](https://www.google.com/maps/search/?api=1&query=The%20Occidental+1475 Pennsylvania Ave NW, Washington, District of Columbia 20004)\n\n$$$$\n\n[American](/washington-dc/cuisines/american)\n\n[Downtown](/washington-dc/neighborhoods/downtown)\n\nOriginally opened in 1906, generations of presidents, senators, and journalists have flocked to The Occidental to make history, or drink their way out of it. The end of the Cuban Missile Crisis was sparked here after a plate of pork chops, and the latest iteration of the restaurant, from Stephen Starr, is as suited to solving geopolitical crises as it is celebrating an anniversary or a promotion. The midcentury menu revives dishes that haven\u2019t been on-trend since the Eisenhower administration, and does them so spectacularly you\u2019ll wonder how exactly they went out of style in the first place. You\u2019ll find the requisite raw bar with oysters and cold king crab legs, but also a nod to Soviet dining in the herring under a fur coat.\n\n[RESERVE A TABLE](https://resy.com/cities/washington-dc/venues/the-occidental)\n\nBirch Thomas\n\n9.0\n\n[## 1789 Restaurant & Bar](/washington-dc/reviews/1789-restaurant-bar)\n\n[1226 36th St NW, Washington, DC 20007](https://www.google.com/maps/search/?api=1&query=1789%20Restaurant%20%26%20Bar+1226 36th St NW, Washington, DC 20007)\n\n$$$$\n\n[American](/washington-dc/cuisines/american)\n\n[Georgetown](/washington-dc/neighborhoods/georgetown)\n\nPerfect For:[Classic Establishment](/washington-dc/perfect-for/classic-establishment)\n\nIf you want to see what DC was like a couple hundred years ago, head to 1789 in [Georgetown](https://www.theinfatuation.com/washington-dc/guides/georgetown-restaurants).

Despite the congressional folks, you can usually just walk in and grab a seat, whether you\u2019re hanging solo at the old-school bar or having a friend date in the dining room. And while you don\u2019t need to dress to the nines, skip the sweats if you want to blend in with the Hill crowd.\n\n[RESERVE A TABLE](http://www.opentable.com/r/the-monocle-washington?ref=16825)\n\nNina Palazzolo\n\n9.0\n\n[## The Bazaar](/washington-dc/reviews/the-bazaar)\n\n[1100 Pennsylvania Ave NW, Washington, D.C. 20004](https://www.google.com/maps/search/?api=1&query=The%20Bazaar+1100 Pennsylvania Ave NW, Washington, D.C. 20004)\n\n$$$$\n\n[Spanish](/washington-dc/cuisines/spanish)\n\n[Penn Quarter](/washington-dc/neighborhoods/penn-quarter)\n\nPerfect For:[Birthdays](/washington-dc/perfect-for/birthdays)[Corporate Cards](/washington-dc/perfect-for/corporate-cards)\n\nJos\u00e9 Andr\u00e9s' DC empire continues with The Bazaar, a Spanish restaurant located in the Waldorf Hotel at the Old Post Office with lush cathedral arches and grand crystal chandeliers. There are cherry blossom trees in full bloom, indoors. It\u2019s dramatic and fantastical\u2014which is exactly the vibe at The Bazaar, where drinks are displayed in clouds of dry ice to guests wearing dark wash jeans and $30,000 watches. On the menu are quirky and creative tapas like cotton candy foie gras. But, as is the flaw with some of Andr\u00e9s\u2019 restaurants, the menu is inconsistent. Some entrees are excellent, like the philly cheesesteak, a deconstructed take on an old-school classic, and some fall flat, like the dragon fruit ceviche served with a peach-ring fruity foam that just does not work.\n\n[RESERVE A TABLE](http://www.opentable.com/r/the-bazaar-by-jose-andres-dc-washington?ref=16825)\n\nRey Lopez\n\n7.8\n\n## DRINKS\n\n[## Hawk 'n' Dove](/washington-dc/reviews/hawk-n-dove)\n\n[329 Pennsylvania Ave SE, Washington, D.C. 20003](https://www.google.com/maps/search/?api=1&query=Hawk%20'n'%20Dove+329 Pennsylvania Ave SE, Washington, D.C. 20003)\n\n$$$$\n\n[Bar Food](/washington-dc/cuisines/bar-food)\n\n[Capitol Hill](/washington-dc/neighborhoods/capitol-hill)\n\nPerfect For:[Classic Establishment](/washington-dc/perfect-for/classic-establishment)[Eating At The Bar](/washington-dc/perfect-for/eating-at-the-bar)\n\nThis Capitol Hill institution is a great place to grab a drink and imagine all the secrets these walls have heard. It looks like an old lodge, full of pictures of ancient men you\u2019ll definitely recognize from their days at 1600 Pennsylvania. There are, of course, Hill staffers and lobbyists hanging around and acting important, but you\u2019ll also find locals swinging by. If you\u2019re lucky enough to come through with an old head, they\u2019re likely to have a Hawk \u2018n\u2019 Dove story that will make you understand how rooted the restaurant is, not just on the Hill, but to the people who make up the fabric of DC.\n\nHawk 'n' Dove\n\n[## Donahue](/washington-dc/reviews/donahue)\n\n[1338 Wisconsin Ave NW, Washington, DC 20007](https://www.google.com/maps/search/?api=1&query=Donahue+1338 Wisconsin Ave NW, Washington, DC 20007)\n\n$$$$\n\n[American](/washington-dc/cuisines/american)\n\n[Georgetown](/washington-dc/neighborhoods/georgetown)\n\nPerfect For:[Drinking Great Cocktails](/washington-dc/perfect-for/drinking-great-cocktails)\n\nThis [Georgetown](https://www.theinfatuation.com/washington-dc/guides/georgetown-restaurants) lounge is an excellent way to wrap a long day of shopping and meandering along the C&O Canal. The inventive cocktail menu includes drinks like the Bay of Bengal, served in a flowered tea cup, or the Sakura, which tastes like a vesper martini served in a sake glass. It\u2019s open until 1am during the week and 2am on the weekends, and feels like a place where you\u2019ll meet a mysterious stranger who is an international spy.

Head over around 4pm so you can grab a seat before the crowd arrives. Named after an area in Baghdad, this Middle Eastern bar serves a bunch of craft cocktails featuring ingredients from that part of the world, like the Women. Life. Freedom, a vodka-based drink with cardamom and rose. The bar does have strong political stances\u2014one of the drinks is called the F\\*ck Trump punch\u2014so do with that what you will.\n\nNina Palazzolo\n\n[## Medina](/washington-dc/reviews/medina)\n\n[1328 Florida Ave NW, Washington, District of Columbia 20009](https://www.google.com/maps/search/?api=1&query=Medina+1328 Florida Ave NW, Washington, District of Columbia 20009)\n\n$$$$\n\n[Middle Eastern](/washington-dc/cuisines/middle-eastern)\n\n[Logan Circle](/washington-dc/neighborhoods/logan-circle)\n\nMedina might be the only bar in DC that we dream about, thanks to their indoor bedouin tent and cocktails so pretty we almost don\u2019t want to drink them. You\u2019ll want to plan ahead for this one, because the best seats in the house are on cushy couches and those require reservations at least a couple weeks out. Once you\u2019ve secured your spot, try the Medusa, made with mezcal and topped with a salty foam, and order some\u00a0 chermoula, kefta hummus full of tiny meatballs, and endless pita bread to go with it.\n\n### How to get into Medina\n\nReservations open 21 days in advance at 10am, but the majority of seating at Medina is held for walk-ins. Reserve a table to bypass the wait, but there's still a chance to spontaneously swing by without fearing your night will be cut short.\n\n[RESERVE A TABLE](https://resy.com/cities/washington-dc/venues/medina-dc)\n\nNina Palazzolo\n\n## BAKERIES\n\n[## Rose Ave Bakery](/washington-dc/reviews/rose-ave-bakery)\n\n[2633 Connecticut Ave NW, Washington, DC 20008](https://www.google.com/maps/search/?api=1&query=Rose%20Ave%20Bakery+2633 Connecticut Ave NW, Washington, DC 20008)\n\n$$$$\n\n[Bakery/Cafe](/washington-dc/cuisines/bakerycafe)\n\n[Woodley Park](/washington-dc/neighborhoods/woodley-park)\n\nPerfect For:[Coffee & A Light Bite](/washington-dc/perfect-for/coffee-a-light-bite)\n\nRose Ave Bakery is our go-to spot for, well, anything you get at a bakery or coffee shop.

Or come before 4pm for an after-zoo snack of black sesame donuts and matcha chocolate chip cookies.

Grab something from the case in the colorful Hill East rowhouse\u2014but get it to go because the kitchen takes up three-quarters of the room and there are only a handful of seats.

There are limited seats, so your best bet is almost always to take your stuff to go.
