September 2024\n\n3 new additions in the nation's capital that caught our Inspectors' attention.\n\n[New Additions](/ca/en/tags/New%20Additions)   [Editor's Pick](/ca/en/tags/Editor%27s%20Pick)   [Washington D.C.](/ca/en/tags/Washington%20D.C.)\n\nMICHELIN Guide [Inspectors](https://guide.michelin.com/us/en/tags/Inspectors) spend all year on the road uncovering the best restaurants to recommend\u2014and what they've found is too good to keep a secret. Whet your appetite with a sneak peek of the [2024 MICHELIN Guide Washington D.C.](https://guide.michelin.com/us/en/district-of-columbia/washington-dc/restaurants)\u2014three new additions spread across the nation's capital.\n\nWant to eat Mexican?

And in case you wanted to know how to explore the nation's capital, [here's](https://guide.michelin.com/us/en/article/dining-out/michelin-guide-washington-dc-restaurants-hotels-guide) how to enjoy it the MICHELIN Guide way.\n\n---\n\n**[Amparo Fondita](https://guide.michelin.com/us/en/district-of-columbia/washington-dc/restaurant/amparo-fondita)***Cuisine: Mexican*\n\nA onetime pop-up, this contemporary Mexican restaurant now enjoys a permanent home in a minimalist space just off Dupont Circle. Chef Christian Irabi\u00e9n prioritizes exceptional ingredients, as in corn sourced from Oaxaca, then nixtamalized in-house. The menu is wide-ranging with selections from the raw bar, appetizers, sopecitos, and an array of main dishes like halibut with mole. Sides, such as a fried plantain that seems simple but is layered with flavor, shouldn't be overlooked. No matter the selection, every dish tempts with creative and contemporary flair. Take the papaya nixtamal. Cooked in\u00a0piloncillo and Mexican vanilla, served over a coconut cream and finished with fennel pollen and wildflower honey, it mystifies with mind-bending complexity.\n\n---\n\n**DISCOVER NOW: [ALL OF NEW YORK'S NEWEST ADDITIONS](https://guide.michelin.com/us/en/article/dining-out/michelin-guide-new-york-new-additions-restaurants)**\n\n---\n\n**[Cucina Morini](https://guide.michelin.com/us/en/district-of-columbia/washington-dc/restaurant/cucina-morini)***Cuisine: Italian*\n\nThis boisterous spot, and little sister to Osteria Morini is a definite crowd-pleaser. The bar is always packed but guests are here for more than just cocktails, as Chef Matt Adler presides over a Sicilian-leaning menu that teems with choices. There are crudos and small plates aplenty, but\u00a0the sfincione, especially when dressed up with stracciatella, is an absolute must. This is straight-up comfort food but done with care and skill. Pastas are made in house, and available as half portions if you want to sample more of the menu. One to consider? The thick gramigna noodles\u00a0tossed with pork sausage, green onion, black pepper, and egg yolk for an almost creamy sauce with a hint of bite. Round out your meal with dessert like bombolini or an affogato sundae.\n\n**[Pascual](https://guide.michelin.com/us/en/district-of-columbia/washington-dc/restaurant/pascual)***Cuisine: Mexican*\n\nPascual may be named for the patron saint of cooks and the kitchen, but this spot from Chefs\u00a0Isabel Coss and Matt Conroy doesn't need any extra blessings (and reservations are a challenge, so plan accordingly). Their casual, contemporary Mexican spot delivers on dishes more often found in Mexico City than in D.C. It's all meant for sharing, and tetelas and tlayudas are always a good idea. Other standouts include a blue corn tamal\u00a0balanced on pickled onion and tomato finished with crema and charred eggplant sauce. Mains, like the lamb neck barbacoa or smoked chicken, are also intended for tucking into with tablemates. End on a sweet note with the bu\u00f1uelo: a crispy rosette dusted in cinnamon sugar and served with cajeta and chocolate sauces.\n\n---\n\n**READ NOW: [CHICAGO'S 2024 NEW ADDITIONS](https://guide.michelin.com/us/en/article/dining-out/michelin-guide-chicago-new-additions)**\n\nHero image:\u00a0Deb Lindsey / Pascual  \nThumb image: Deb Lindsey / Pascual\n\n---\n\nWritten by **MICHELIN Guide**\n\n## Dining Out\n\n[Dining Out](/ca/en/articles/dining-out)   2 minutes\n\n### [Sweet Spot: Nic\u014dsi Earns a Star With a Dessert-Only Tasting Menu](/ca/en/article/dining-out/nicosi-san-antonio-dessert-michelin-guide)\n\nPastry chefs take center stage at this San Antonio spot.\n\n[Desserts](/ca/en/tags/Desserts)   [Editor's Pick](/ca/en/tags/Editor%27s%20Pick)   [MICHELIN Star](/ca/en/tags/MICHELIN%20Star)\n\n[Dining Out](/ca/en/articles/dining-out)   2 minutes\n\n### [The Best Sandwiches in North America](/ca/en/article/dining-out/the-best-sandwiches-in-north-america)\n\nThe MICHELIN Guide Inspectors share their top picks between the bread.\n\n[Casual](/ca/en/tags/Casual)   [sandwiches](/ca/en/tags/sandwiches)   [Bib Gourmand](/ca/en/tags/Bib%20Gourmand)\n\n[Dining Out](/ca/en/articles/dining-out)   9 minutes\n\n### [Dine Out Vancouver 2026's MICHELIN Guide Restaurants](/ca/en/article/dining-out/dine-out-vancouver-festival-michelin-star-guide-restaurant-week)\n\nFrom January 21 through February 8, Vancouver is serving up flavor at unbeatable prices.\n\n[Hotels](/ca/en/tags/Hotels)   [Vancouver](/ca/en/tags/Vancouver)   [Editor's Pick](/ca/en/tags/Editor%27s%20Pick)\n\n[Dining Out](/ca/en/articles/dining-out)   5 minutes\n\n### [Where to Eat Along New York's Thanksgiving Parade](/ca/en/article/dining-out/where-to-eat-near-new-york-city-macys-thanksgiving-parade-michelin-guide)\n\nBrave the crowds, then feast nearby.\n\n[New York](/ca/en/tags/New%20York)   [NYC](/ca/en/tags/NYC)   [Editor's Pick](/ca/en/tags/Editor%27s%20Pick)\n\n[All articles of Dining Out](/ca/en/articles/dining-out)\n\n## Keep Exploring - Stories we think you will enjoy reading\n\n[Travel](/ca/en/articles/travel)   3 minutes\n\n### [The Reinvention of the Ryokan](/ca/en/article/travel/the-reinvention-of-the-ryokan-michelin-keys-guide)\n\nThe New Year is the most important holiday in Japan.

This is the Guide\u2019s second year in the Nation\u2019s capital following the inaugural edition in 2017.\n\nThis year's roster of restaurants welcomes two new additions, Komi and M\u00e9tier, bringing the total number of starred establishments in the guide to 14.\n\n\"Our inspectors have thoroughly enjoyed the progression and evolution demonstrated through consistency of the restaurant scene in D.C.,\" says Michael Ellis, international director of the MICHELIN Guide. \"Every restaurant recognized last year has maintained exceptional quality and steadiness. Notably this year, our inspectors found the kitchens of chefs Johnny Monis (Komi) and Eric Ziebold (M\u00e9tier) to exude finesse, demonstrate fine attention to detail and serve high-quality, top-notch cuisine.\"\n\n[Komi](http://komirestaurant.com/) is a menu-less \"diminutive restaurant with a focus on drama\" housed within a Dupont Circle townhouse. Given society's immense attachment to the internet, it's ironic that diners wishing to score a seat at one of the restaurant's 14 tables must resort to the telephone to make a reservation. Once inside, patrons encounter roughly a dozen primarily seafood-focused courses from chef Johnny Monis, who is co-owner with his wife Anne Marler.\n\nWith [M\u00e9tier](http://metierdc.com/), chef Eric Ziebold now has two separate Michelin-starred restaurants under the same roof. (Kinship, Ziebold and his wife/partner C\u00e9lia Laurent's \u00e0 la carte spot, earned a star in last year's inaugural list.)

[MICHELIN Star](/ca/en/tags/MICHELIN%20Star)\n\nWashington, D.C. is a dynamic place, and while the city is always making news, its culinary scene is just as exciting. Just like the U.S., the city's restaurants speak to a melting pot of cultures and cuisines, and D.C.'s best restaurants also reflect that ethos. There's everything from haute contemporary dining to Middle Eastern, Peruvian, Latina American, Spanish and Italian. Several Japanese or Asian-influenced restaurants are counted among the city's best, too.\n\nBelow, discover all of the Two- and Three-MICHELIN Starred restaurants, as well as the Green Stars in The MICHELIN Guide Washington, D.C. 2025.\n\n---\n\n## Two Stars\n\n[J\u00f4nt](https://guide.michelin.com/us/en/district-of-columbia/washington-dc/restaurant/jont)   \nCuisine: Contemporary  \nChef Ryan Ratino's ambitious counter is an experience like nothing else in the city. Sitting just above Bresca, the room is a constant hive of activity with sharp-suited servers gliding about and laser-focused chefs working in perfect tandem. From the cutlery to the cooking, expect beauty and boldness. Top-rate seafood and meat from Japan and beautiful sauces form the core of this menu. Think delicate tarts with wagyu tartare, grilled sawara with beet and pomegranate sauce, and a particularly striking king crab rice cooked in a donabe. Dessert is its own counter that ends with a treasure box of mignardises. All throughout, a high-energy playlist matches a high-performing team who want nothing more than for guests to enjoy themselves.\n\n[minibar](https://guide.michelin.com/us/en/district-of-columbia/washington-dc/restaurant/minibar)  \nCuisine: Contemporary  \nA single door, with a host to match, marks the entrance to this culinary laboratory that goes far beyond its tiny name. Dinner begins in the lounge with a fun, brainy cocktail before moving to the main room where guests settle in at a curved counter built around a stainless-steel workspace. Through a series of small bites and courses, whimsy and surprise are driving forces of inspiration. From chicharron with avocado to cauliflower with caviar, nothing is ever quite what it seems. The fun is carried through to the very end. A recent riff on mango sticky rice was a playful delight followed by the signature, crowd-pleasing fried ice cream donut. Along the edges of the room, sharply suited servers ensure a seamless, sincere experience.\n\n[The Inn at Little Washington](https://guide.michelin.com/us/en/district-of-columbia/washington-dc/restaurant/the-inn-at-little-washington)  \nCuisine: American   \nThe iconic Chef Patrick O\u2019Connell has long been the steward of this idyllic restaurant outside Washington, D.C. In a town whose very existence seems tied to his success, dinner here recalls another era. The dining room is a celebration of maximalist d\u00e9cor and stately grandeur.   \nThe menu offers an array of signature preparations, such as the vegetable-forward ratatouille from the garden with roasted garlic custard, the contemporary-minded, tomato-cured hamachi in watermelon gazpacho, and the enduring classic of lobster mousse wrapped in Savoy cabbage dressed with caviar beurre blanc. And all throughout, roaming bread and cheese carts are a reminder of a luxury that\u2019s less and less common.\n\n---\n\n## One Star\n\n[Albi](https://guide.michelin.com/us/en/district-of-columbia/washington-dc/restaurant/albi)   \nCuisine: Middle Eastern  \nThis Navy Yard denizen is hip and lively. Arranged around a roaring hearth, the space also features an inviting bar. Albi is a sterling example of open-fire cooking at its best. \u00c0 la carte is one way to go, but guests may just do better with the hyper-seasonal tasting menu. Regardless, Chef/owner Michael Rafidi's dishes are full of surprises as he weaves in the flavors of the eastern Mediterranean with a myriad of local ingredients. Favorites like baba ghanoush and kefta are handled with precision, but the tastiest dishes come from the wood-fired hearth, imbued with smoke and char. A dessert of brown butter knafeh with yogurt ice cream is a marvel, while the wine program flaunts a litany of Mediterranean and Middle Eastern labels.\n\n[Bresca](https://guide.michelin.com/us/en/district-of-columbia/washington-dc/restaurant/bresca)  \nCuisine: Contemporary  \nIt's set on busy 14th Street, but beautiful Bresca far from blends in with the crowd. Instead, it mixes the warmth of a neighborhood treasure with the talent of a special occasion spot. Inside, splashes of gold, a living wall crafted from moss and design elements teetering between whimsical and downright surreal, create a contemporary vibe. The cooking is casual yet ambitious, thanks to Chef Ryan Ratino\u2019s cutting-edge credentials. Find a clear sense of artistry in the likes of a foie gras \"negroni\" topped with Campari gel\u00e9e or the agreeably priced and perfect pappardelle with lamb rag\u00f9. Service is highly professional without a trace of pretense.   \nCocktails, like The Daulphine St. Punch, may be relished in lieu of dessert.\n\n[Causa](https://guide.michelin.com/us/en/district-of-columbia/washington-dc/restaurant/causa)  \nCuisine: Peruvian  \nChef Carlos Delgado delivers a taste of his birthplace in a dual concept space in Blagden Alley. Nestled on the first floor, Causa seats around 20 for a tasting menu that takes diners on a journey of flavors inspired by Nikkei cuisine, blending Japanese heritage with Peruvian ingredients and technique. It all begins in Lima with coastal seafood, then progresses into the Andes and the Amazon. Chicha morada kombucha, made from purple corn, is a perfect partner for the Peruvian classic and namesake dish, causa, with its mashed potatoes hit with aji amarillo paste, then topped with cucumber, avocado and tuna tartare. A beautifully cooked wagyu is finished with a Peruvian au poivre sauce. Dessert definitely doesn't disappoint, as in the passion fruit and mint gelato scoops piped with macambo mousse.\n\n[Elcielo Washington](https://guide.michelin.com/us/en/district-of-columbia/washington-dc/restaurant/elcielo-d-c)   \nCuisine: Colombian  \nThis concept from Chef Juan Manuel Barrientos can be found adjacent to Union Market's La Cosecha. Presentation is the cornerstone here, with an admirable level of showmanship, and dishes embody a love letter to the chef's native Colombia. This is deeply personal cooking, with the chef utilizing Colombian ingredients in dishes that share history and purpose.   \nTwo set menus are served throughout the restaurant's two dining rooms. From the snacks to the corn broth that makes you rethink this staple to the chocotherapy dessert, this dining experience is seamless. The ingredients are Colombian, many of the dishes have history, purpose and definition. All the while, a warm staff enhances the experience.\n\n[Fiola](https://guide.michelin.com/us/en/district-of-columbia/washington-dc/restaurant/fiola)  \nCuisine: Italian  \nWith stone walls, seasonal arrangements and Warhol-esque prints, this DC powerhouse is equal parts retro glitz and country lodge. Before even crossing the threshold, diners are met by gracious servers. While they may rhapsodize about their favorite dishes, take your time to peruse the menu, complete with stunning creations and playful twists.   \nClassic and modern elements come together in the regional Italian food, which is as likely to celebrate Roman inspiration as it is to represent Venetian flavors. Cubetto Genovese D'Antra, or delightful squares stuffed with shredded duck ragu and sauced with a duck jus reduction, is a memorable dish. Lamb with red pepper gel and eggplant caponata is another standout.\n\n[Gravitas](https://guide.michelin.com/us/en/district-of-columbia/washington-dc/restaurant/gravitas)   \nCuisine: Contemporary   \nChef Matt Baker is luring diners to Ivy City with this gorgeous spot, which transforms local products into modern, deeply complex items. The d\u00e9cor pays homage to the place's industrial bones with exposed brick and stark walls, softened by greenery. Fine service and an open kitchen enhance the appeal.   \nSet menus are available with three, four, and six courses to choose from, along with some supplements. Wonderful yellowfin sashimi comes with a complex soy vinaigrette while the tagliatelle with sweetbreads in a pork and pancetta ragu with brown butter cream and sun chokes is a standout. For dessert, it has to be his riff on a Butterfinger with salted caramel, peanut butter nougat, chocolate cremeux, salted caramel ice cream, and candied peanuts.\n\n[Imperfecto: The Chef's Table](https://guide.michelin.com/us/en/district-of-columbia/washington-dc/restaurant/imperfecto-the-chef-s-table)   \nCuisine: Latin American  \nBoasting all the buzz of a hornet\u2019s nest, this soaring box of glass and marble virtually reaches for the sky. Inside, it's decked out with brass accents, terra-cotta, and a tight counter positioned directly under Chef Enrique Limardo\u2019s perch. The counter functions as a restaurant within a restaurant with room for just a handful of diners to enjoy an elaborate tasting menu that celebrates Latin flavors, ace ingredients, and exacting technique.   \nThe attention to detail is superb, and meals take on an intimate form. Dishes, perhaps aged grouper with BBQ lettuce and broccolini tabbouleh, or duck with Carolina rice, hum with flavor. Desserts are equally skillful, as in pickled peach with matcha sponge cake.\n\n[Kinship](https://guide.michelin.com/us/en/district-of-columbia/washington-dc/restaurant/kinship)  \nCuisine: Contemporary   \nKinship is a prominent fixture thanks to Chef Eric Ziebold and wife/partner C\u00e9lia Laurent\u2019s inspired cuisine. They have earned a devoted following who gladly dress to dine here. In addition to M\u00e9tier downstairs, the space comprises a fireplace-warmed lounge, lively bar, and minimalist-chic dining room.   \nThe \u00e0 la carte is driven by the seasons, changing often to adapt to what's available. The food hums with flavor and balance, as in Catalan spiced confit squid with tempura tentacles, lemon shallot gremolata, and Romesco sauce, or perfectly rendered and lacquered duck. For desserts, any of them seal the deal, but the roasted Maui pineapple with coconut frangipane, lime all-spice cream, and pineapple sherbet is a fierce competitor.\n\n[Little Pearl](https://guide.michelin.com/us/en/district-of-columbia/washington-dc/restaurant/little-pearl)   \nCuisine: Contemporary  \nJust down the street from Rose\u2019s Luxury and Pineapple and Pearls, this intimate bo\u00eete is yet another feather in the same restaurant group\u2019s proverbial cap. Possessing all the charm of a carriage house, the dining room is closer to a sunroom encased in glass with expansive views of the green surroundings. The cooking is equally attractive: Seasonal fare prepared with panache and a touch of luxury. Think oysters with fried potatoes and seaweed remoulade or poached pears with bay leaf ice cream. The menu is a revolving door of ideas, except for the signature angel egg amuse. An eclectic wine list makes for a thoughtful pairing. In total, dinner here goes for less than other tasting menus in town, but with no less boldness, care, and creativity.\n\n[Masseria](https://guide.michelin.com/us/en/district-of-columbia/washington-dc/restaurant/masseria)  \nCuisine: Italian   \nWith its seamless blend of indoor and outdoor spaces, this is a shining beacon amid high-rises, restaurants and stores. Donning that requisite brick walls and farmhouse vibe, the former warehouse feels glam yet spartan\u2014with a stainless-steel kitchen, chrome accents and an impressive glass-encased wine cellar. Such a feel-good sense extends to the staff, who clearly like working here as much as diners enjoy lingering over meals.   \nChef/owner Nicholas Stefanelli's Puglian heritage comes through in the menu. His dishes hit all the right notes, balancing playful with serious elements, as in the turbot with mazza frissa and brown butter-poached artichoke hearts or creamy risotto packed with parmesan, butter and fermented black truffle oil. Lemon souffle with lemon verbena gelato is a strong finish.\n\n[M\u00e9tier](https://guide.michelin.com/us/en/district-of-columbia/washington-dc/restaurant/metier)  \nCuisine: Contemporary   \nM\u00e9tier's spare and sleek dining space may be best described as one part living room and two parts art gallery, and a window to the kitchen gives a taste of what is to come. The space is elegant, and the service echoes the sophistication with an attentive eye. Chef Eric Ziebold plies his \"metier\" in an ambitious tasting that pulls global flavors in inspired ways. A riff on cassoulet, for instance, unveils flageolet bean pur\u00e9e with a pork jowl croquette and Santa Barbara uni. The crowning flourish is a sorbet made from aji dulce peppers grown at the restaurant's garden in Virginia. A satin-smooth, double fermented chocolate ganache with toasted fennel-cr\u00e8me anglaise is as stunning as it is ingenious.\n\n[Mita](https://guide.michelin.com/us/en/district-of-columbia/washington-dc/restaurant/mita)   \nCuisine: Vegetarian   \nLatin American cuisine, only plant based. That's the premise behind this contemporary space set in the Shaw neighborhood. It's tasting menu only, but short and long formats ensure a fit. Chefs Tatiana Mora and Miguel Guerra share their creative spirit here, where influences span from Brazil and Bolivia to Colombia and dishes sport originality. A basket of arepas is a fun dish featuring a variety of textures and flavors with tasty sauces like guasacaca, cashew sour cream with chili oil, and butter made of chontaduro. Watermelon crudo with fermented carrot in a cucumber leche de tigre sauce is inventive and bold, while a slice of mushroom terrine wrapped in greens with layers of potato delivers on umami, bite after bite.\n\n[Omakase at Barracks Row](https://guide.michelin.com/us/en/district-of-columbia/washington-dc/restaurant/omakase-at-barracks-row)  \nCuisine: Japanese   \nChef Yi \"Ricky\" Wang, who trained under Chef Nakazawa before running a series of pop-ups, is now settled in at this counter, located up a set of metal stairs in an industrial-chic space. Take special note of the paintings that line that staircase\u2014they're nods to a longstanding tradition of fishermen brushing their catch with ink and pressing it into rice paper\u2014and you may be presented with a similar piece at your meal.   \nChef Wang's omakase features a few otsumami, perhaps poached sweet shrimp in a smoked Maine uni sauce, before progressing to nigiri. It's all impressive, from the Boston surf clam finished with kumquat kosho to the hay-smoked Spanish mackerel sourced from the Carolinas that's bold but balanced. Musk melon with strawberries imported from Japan is a satisfying finale.\n\n[Oyster Oyster](https://guide.michelin.com/us/en/district-of-columbia/washington-dc/restaurant/oyster-oyster)   \nCuisine: Vegetarian   \nIt is highly rare for a tasting menu to leave one feeling\u2014well\u2014energized, but so goes the imaginative cooking at this vegetable-focused gem where local farms are the very essence of this passionate operation. The imaginative compositions from Chef Rob Rubba and his team offer delicious insights into what is possible with vegetables. There is true creativity here, as in a pasta course which features agnolotti filled with a creamy eggplant and house-grown mushrooms, served brodo-style with a roasted corn broth and accompanied by a truffle tart. Even bread service is special\u2014enriched with \"garleeks\" and accompanied by sunflower seed and marigold \"butter.\" A baton of summer squash is elevated by a filling of pumpkin seed \"ricotta.\"\n\n[Pineapple and Pearls](https://guide.michelin.com/us/en/district-of-columbia/washington-dc/restaurant/pineapple-and-pearls)  \nCuisine: Contemporary   \nWith oversized Champagne bottles, velvet dinner jackets, and balloons galore, Chef Aaron Silverman\u2019s Pineapple and Pearls focuses on playful reverie; the upbeat mood rings closer to a New Year\u2019s Eve party, and guests are encouraged to dress to impress. Dinner is a noticeably condensed affair, punctuated with potent surprises like tableside absinthe cocktails and truffle-infused amaretto warmed over candlelight. Everything comes with a story, and the approachable staff is happy to tell these tales. The equally friendly sommelier is always at the ready with terrific suggestions to pair with dishes like marinated tuna with compressed watermelon and the feather-light gnocchi with rich parmesan cream.\n\n[Rania](https://guide.michelin.com/us/en/district-of-columbia/washington-dc/restaurant/rania)   \nCuisine: Indian   \nThis fine dining concept seems fit for a queen, and good thing too, since Rania translates to \"queen\" in Hindi and Sanskrit. The team delivers something entirely enticing here with an inventive menu. There are plenty of contemporary touches along with a few surprises with dishes like chana masala panisse dressed with green garlic chutney, or hay-aged pork vindaloo featuring tender flavorful loin and a block of crispy skin belly accompanied by a rich bowlful of dal Kolhapuri, fluffy Kashmiri pulao and butter-brushed hot naan. Cocktails are designed to complement the rich, bold flavors.  \n  \n  \n[Rooster & Owl](https://guide.michelin.com/us/en/district-of-columbia/washington-dc/restaurant/rooster-owl)   \nCuisine: Contemporary   \nA talented husband-and-wife duo is behind this appealingly contemporary, hipster hot spot. The setting is the perfect match for its modern, edgy cuisine, which meanders from the Middle East and Mediterranean all the way to Asia. There is unabashed creativity unleashed in such dishes as ricotta gnudi along with a frothy sour cream soubise and lemon beurre. Baby carrots with labneh and cashew pesto are an alluring side dish, while the pistachio olive oil cake with goat cheese mousse, blackberry and candied pistachio will leave a lasting impression. Since you get to mix and match menu items, the bar follows suit and tailors wine options to guests' selections.\n\n[Rose\u2019s Luxury](https://guide.michelin.com/us/en/district-of-columbia/washington-dc/restaurant/rose-s-luxury)   \nCuisine: Contemporary   \nThis dining room is all about fun, with a laid-back d\u00e9cor including exposed bulbs strung above the counter facing into the open kitchen, lending a convivial mood that\u2019s like dining in a friend's backyard. The family-style prix fixe menu has its own cheeky tone, starting with the \"really, really, really good challah\" (and it is), served with an artful ruffle of caraway honey butter. The cooking is equal parts approachable and ingenious, as in a signature salad of spiced pork paired with airy coconut cream and lychee, spiked with lime juice and a bevy of fresh herbs, or Korean rice cakes coated with a creamy, spicy gochujang alla vodka sauce. Desserts offer their own excitement, as in a sticky toffee pudding enhanced with earthy, complex mole negro, paired with a soothing horchata ice cream.\n\n[Sushi Nakazawa](https://guide.michelin.com/us/en/district-of-columbia/washington-dc/restaurant/sushi-nakazawa1160153)  \nCuisine: Japanese   \nThis second outpost of Chef Daisuke Nakazawa\u2019s critically acclaimed sushi house is elegant and intimate with dark wood and gold accents. For the best seat, angle for one of the leather stools at the marble counter, where you can watch the itamae work their magic. The team works in a tidy fashion, their hands moving as adeptly as a surgeon along meticulously organized counters. Ingredients are sourced both locally and from abroad and each course is presented like a revelation\u2014from Japanese sumi ika with shiso and pickled plum sauce to lightly torched kama toro with spicy daikon. It will take you a couple of hours to work your way through the luxurious 20-course omakase of the chef, who trained under the legendary Jiro Ono, but rest assured it is time well spent.\n\n[Tail Up Goat](https://guide.michelin.com/us/en/district-of-columbia/washington-dc/restaurant/tail-up-goat)   \nCuisine: Contemporary   \nWhen three forward-thinking restaurateurs combine their talents, the result is bound to be an easygoing haven, where the food, drinks, and hospitality mesh effortlessly. Fittingly, the mood here is buzzy, but don\u2019t be fooled by the casual vibe, as this kitchen team is serious.   \nStart with an assortment of snacks, including a crudit\u00e9 of radishes and wax beans with white miso dip, or a crisp tart shell filled with creamy eggplant and serrano pepper apricot relish. Mains offer a refined take on Americana classics, like steak and potatoes with a seared strip steak and a crunchy potato pav\u00e9 with a dusting of green onion powder. To finish, consider the rather un-French version of baba au rhum, featuring apricot honey, toasted marshmallow, and vanilla gelato.\n\n[The Dabney](https://guide.michelin.com/us/en/district-of-columbia/washington-dc/restaurant/the-dabney)   \nCuisine: American  \nThe Dabney exudes charming, contemporary farmhouse vibes with its exposed brick, light walls, and dark wood, and the look is completed by a slickly arranged open kitchen complete with a wood-fired hearth. Chef/owner Jeremiah Langhorne serves up the flavors of the Mid-Atlantic with a hint of a Southern accent and the tasting menu is a deeper, more committed expression of the team's talents. Begin with bite-sized snacks including their pie crust tart with pickled blueberries, granola crumble, and cheese fondue or their Madeira compressed melon. Then, hearth-roasted vegetables are served over a bed of farro salad with whipped ricotta, herbs from their rooftop garden, and finished with a pour of a basil sauce. American wagyu cap grilled over coals is accompanied by eggplant prepared three ways for a perfectly satisfying main dish.\n\n[Xiquet](https://guide.michelin.com/us/en/district-of-columbia/washington-dc/restaurant/xiquet)   \nCuisine: Spanish  \nChef Danny Lled\u00f3's kitchen is equipped with a smoker and a wood-fired hearth to produce a menu that proudly extols Spanish cuisine with a focus on the delights of Valencia. Morsels like dill-cured bonito arranged with creamy, cool ajo blanco lead up to heartier compositions such as crisped-skin turbot with smoked trout roe-studded beurre blanc. The rice preparations steal the show, like the Alicante-style rice with rabbit and mushrooms cooked over the hearth. The meal is creative and intriguing, while showcasing first-rate products procured with an eye toward sustainability. The sparely elegant third-floor room hosts a mere handful of tables. After dinner, guests are invited to conclude the evening with coffee and mignardise in the lounge.\n\n---\n\n## Green Stars\n\n[The Inn at Little Washington](https://guide.michelin.com/us/en/district-of-columbia/washington-dc/restaurant/the-inn-at-little-washington)  \nCuisine: American\n\n[Oyster Oyster](https://guide.michelin.com/us/en/district-of-columbia/washington-dc/restaurant/oyster-oyster)  \nCuisine: Vegetarian\n\n---\n\n**Related Reads:** [The full list of recommended restaurants in Washington, D.C.](https://guide.michelin.com/us/en/district-of-columbia/washington-dc/restaurants?sort=distance)\n\n[The Best Value Restaurants in Washington, D.C. 2025](https://guide.michelin.com/us/en/article/michelin-guide-ceremony/the-most-affordable-restaurants-in-washington-d.c.-in-2025)\n\n---\n\nHero image: \u00a9Rey lopez/Causa\n\n---\n\nWritten by **The MICHELIN Guide**\n\n## MICHELIN Guide Ceremony\n\n[MICHELIN Guide Ceremony](/ca/en/articles/michelin-guide-ceremony)   2 minutes\n\n### [All the Stars and Bib Gourmands in the First MICHELIN Guide to Philadelphia 2025](/ca/en/article/michelin-guide-ceremony/all-the-stars-and-bib-gourmands-in-the-first-michelin-guide-to-philadelphia-2025)\n\nThe best restaurants in the City of Brotherly Love, according to our Inspectors.\n\n[Bib Gourmand](/ca/en/tags/Bib%20Gourmand)   [Philadelphia](/ca/en/tags/Philadelphia)   [MICHELIN Star](/ca/en/tags/MICHELIN%20Star)\n\n[MICHELIN Guide Ceremony](/ca/en/articles/michelin-guide-ceremony)   3 minutes\n\n### [All the Stars and Bib Gourmands in The MICHELIN Guide Boston 2025](/ca/en/article/michelin-guide-ceremony/all-the-stars-and-bib-gourmands-in-the-michelin-guide-boston-2025)\n\nThe MICHELIN Guide Inspectors' top picks for the inaugural selection.\n\n[Editor's Pick](/ca/en/tags/Editor%27s%20Pick)   [Boston](/ca/en/tags/Boston)   [MICHELIN Guide Ceremony](/ca/en/tags/MICHELIN%20Guide%20Ceremony)\n\n[MICHELIN Guide Ceremony](/ca/en/articles/michelin-guide-ceremony)   2 minutes\n\n### [All the Stars in The MICHELIN Guide to New York City 2025](/ca/en/article/michelin-guide-ceremony/all-the-stars-in-the-michelin-guide-to-new-york-city-2025)\n\nThese are the city's best restaurants, according to our Inspectors.\n\n[MICHELIN Star](/ca/en/tags/MICHELIN%20Star)   [Green Star Community](/ca/en/tags/Green%20Star%20Community)   [New York](/ca/en/tags/New%20York)\n\n[MICHELIN Guide Ceremony](/ca/en/articles/michelin-guide-ceremony)   1 minute\n\n### [New York's Best Value Restaurants in 2025](/ca/en/article/michelin-guide-ceremony/the-most-affordable-restaurants-in-new-york-city)\n\nThese MICHELIN Bib Gourmands are palate pleasing and budget friendly.\n\n[Bib Gourmand](/ca/en/tags/Bib%20Gourmand)   [New York](/ca/en/tags/New%20York)   [New York](/ca/en/tags/New%20York)\n\n[All articles of MICHELIN Guide Ceremony](/ca/en/articles/michelin-guide-ceremony)\n\n## Keep Exploring - Stories we think you will enjoy reading\n\n[Dining Out](/ca/en/articles/dining-out)   2 minutes\n\n### [Sweet Spot: Nic\u014dsi Earns a Star With a Dessert-Only Tasting Menu](/ca/en/article/dining-out/nicosi-san-antonio-dessert-michelin-guide)\n\nPastry chefs take center stage at this San Antonio spot.\n\n[Desserts](/ca/en/tags/Desserts)   [Editor's Pick](/ca/en/tags/Editor%27s%20Pick)   [MICHELIN Star](/ca/en/tags/MICHELIN%20Star)\n\n[Features](/ca/en/articles/features)   3 minutes\n\n### [Feld Earns One MICHELIN Star in Year Two](/ca/en/article/features/feld-michelin-star-jake-potashnick)\n\nChef Jake Potashnick serves 25 to 30 thoughtfully composed bites, delivering a truly memorable dining experience.\n\n[Chicago](/ca/en/tags/Chicago)   [Editor's Pick](/ca/en/tags/Editor%27s%20Pick)   [One MICHELIN Star](/ca/en/tags/One%20MICHELIN%20Star)\n\n[MICHELIN Guide Ceremony](/ca/en/articles/michelin-guide-ceremony)   1 minute\n\n### [The Best Value Restaurants in Washington, D.C. in 2025](/ca/en/article/michelin-guide-ceremony/the-most-affordable-restaurants-in-washington-d.c.-in-2025)\n\nThe MICHELIN Guide's Bib Gourmands deliver on flavor and value.\n\n[Washington D.C.](/ca/en/tags/Washington%20D.C.)

Offering a range of different cuisines, his restaurants never stop delighting and surprising diners.\n\nIn the city, many of his spots have been recognized by The MICHELIN Guide, including [minibar](https://guide.michelin.com/us/en/district-of-columbia/washington-dc/restaurant/minibar) (Two Stars), [Zaytinya](https://guide.michelin.com/us/en/district-of-columbia/washington-dc/restaurant/zaytinya) (Bib Gourmand), [Oyamel](https://guide.michelin.com/us/en/district-of-columbia/washington-dc/restaurant/oyamel) (Bib Gourmand), and [Jaleo](https://guide.michelin.com/us/en/district-of-columbia/washington-dc/restaurant/jaleo). Outside of the city, delicious spots abound, such as [San Laurel](https://guide.michelin.com/us/en/california/us-los-angeles/restaurant/san-laurel) in Los Angeles, [Bar Mar](https://guide.michelin.com/us/en/illinois/chicago/restaurant/bar-mar) in Chicago, and [Jaleo in Dubai](https://guide.michelin.com/us/en/dubai-emirate/dubai/restaurant/jaleo-1206454).\n\nNot limiting his knowledge of food to his own restaurants, Chef Andr\u00e9s has long spread his talents and heart globally to those who need it the most. He founded World Central Kitchen to provide fresh meals in times of crisis, which earned him the Presidential Medal of Freedom.\n\nWith a remarkable palate and genuine care for others, where does the chef himself eat? From Maryland blue crabs to Vietnamese B\u00fan Ch\u1ea3 H\u00e0 N\u1ed9i, learn where Andr\u00e9s dines in Washington, D.C., the city he calls home.\n\n---\n\n## What makes Washington, D.C. special?\n\nWashington is not only the political capital of the country\u2026I would say in many ways it\u2019s our culinary capital too! Here you\u2019ll find that the flavors, dishes, and ingredients from all across the world are celebrated in our small but diverse and very international city. For me personally, Washington holds a special place because I\u2019ve called it home for 30 years, and it\u2019s where I met my wife and raised three amazing daughters. And of course it\u2019s where I became an American citizen.\n\n## What is your favorite restaurant in D.C.?\n\nWould I ask you to pick a favorite child, or a favorite friend? This is sometimes an impossible choice, there are so many restaurants in D.C. that I love, since I\u2019ve lived here for so many years. I would say that I have special love for my friend [Patrick O'Connell](https://guide.michelin.com/us/en/article/sustainable-gastronomy/the-inn-at-little-washington-washington-dc-three-star-green-star-sustainability-michelin-guide) and his [Inn at Little Washington](https://guide.michelin.com/us/en/district-of-columbia/washington-dc/restaurant/the-inn-at-little-washington), where they have been creating magic for nearly 50 years.\n\n## Where do you go for simple comfort food?\n\nFor me, a boy of Spain where we are surrounded by the ocean, seafood is my comfort food, so one of my favorite places for simple, good food is Bethesda Crab House\u2014there is nothing more comforting and wonderful than enjoying blue crabs on a hot summer day there. Or if you want to drive a bit farther, you can go to Crab Claw out in St. Michael\u2019s. That tastes like home.\n\n## Who has the most creative menu?\n\nI know I am biased, but minibar! Not because it is my restaurant, it\u2019s the restaurant of the most incredible creative minds at work together, like a symphony, all coming together for an unbelievable dining experience. I would also say that my good friend\u00a0[Chef Johnny Spero](https://guide.michelin.com/us/en/article/features/washington-dc-one-michelin-star-reverie-chef-johnny-spero) at [Reverie](https://guide.michelin.com/us/en/district-of-columbia/washington-dc/restaurant/reverie) is a culinary force whose cooking you must experience for yourself.\n\n## Where do you go for a classic D.C. meal?\n\nMaybe the most classic of classics is Old Ebbitt Grill, which opened even before Lincoln lived in the White House, one block away. You can get lost in time there, eating some of the best oysters in the area, drinking a beer or a glass of sparkling wine, having a conversation with the bartenders.\n\n## Where is best to bring the whole family?\n\nI don\u2019t know about your family, but my family loves to eat. One of the best places for a big, satisfying dinner that will take me back to my own childhood is Casa Teresa, run by the brilliant chef Rub\u00e9n Garc\u00eda, who used to work with me at minibar. He is cooking classic Catalan dishes like the ones he grew up with (and me too!) so this is a perfect place to share with the people you love.\n\n## How about for a business meeting?\n\nI know it\u2019s not a fair answer, but I usually prefer to cook at my own house when I\u2019m having a big conversation\u2026I can pick the menu, pick the wines, set the seating arrangements\u2026it puts everyone in a better mood around the table, which makes for better business!\n\n## Where would you go for a big celebration?\n\nJaleo! That\u2019s exactly what Jaleo is all about - gathering around a big paella with your friends and family to share the very best rice dish on the planet. Kevin Tien\u2019s [Moon Rabbit](https://guide.michelin.com/us/en/district-of-columbia/washington-dc/restaurant/moon-rabbit) is another incredible place to celebrate. I love the B\u00fan Ch\u1ea3 H\u00e0 N\u1ed9i, crispy skin pork belly, or to just let Chef Kevin decide and eat whatever he thinks is best that day!\n\n## Any hidden gems in the city?\n\nIs it hidden if I tell you?\n\n## Do you have a favorite hotel in D.C.?\n\nThe Waldorf-Astoria, where Jos\u00e9 Andr\u00e9s Group has The Bazaar, was for many years DC\u2019s Old Post Office. From 1892 to 1899 it was the U.S. Post Office Department Headquarters and is the second-tallest structure in the nation\u2019s capital, after the Washington Monument. It\u2019s a beautiful landmark building on Pennsylvania Avenue right between The White House and the U.S. Capitol near National Mall museums, the Washington Monument, and Lincoln Memorial\u2026and the hotel rooms are beautiful!\n\n## What are your favorite attractions?\n\nThe National Portrait Gallery is right in between my first restaurant, Jaleo, and Zaytinya so I like to take the long way between the two and will duck in and take a moment to reflect and dream. I am so honored to have my own portrait here created by Kadir Nelson.\n\n## Which chef would you like to invite next to *Longer Tables*?\n\nOne of the most amazing chefs you\u2019ve never heard of is a woman named Cristeta Comerford, she was the Executive Chef at the White House and cooked there for 30 years! Talk about a legend\u2026I\u2019d love to talk to her on the podcast.\n\n## What advice would you give to newer chefs?\n\nTo understand the power of \u201cwe the people\u201d is the greatest gift America has given me. When you are starting out in your career, it\u2019s easy to think it\u2019s all about proving what you know, what you can do, but the real power is when you realize it is not about you but WE. Nothing can be done well in a kitchen without being in harmony with one another.\n\n## Besides your family and closest friends, who would you invite to eat a Michelin Star meal?\n\nI would be happy to invite to dinner anyone who sees the world differently than I do. I think that eating together is a powerful way to connect to someone, a moment to see beyond the differences and reach a deeper understanding, no matter where you are coming from.\n\n## You were a recipient of the Presidential Medal of Freedom. What does this mean to you?\n\nWhen I first arrived to Washington D.C. in 1993, Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan told me\u2026\u201cif you love America, America will always love you back.\u201d As an immigrant, I\u2019m humbled to receive the Presidential Medal of Freedom. I know that immigrants can be bridges\u2026we build the longer tables that connect us all. And I believe we all share a responsibility to create an even better America, one where the American dream can be achieved by everyone\u2026regardless of what you look like or where you come from. Chefs like me feed the few, but our destiny is to feed the many. To be an army of goodness where a plate of food becomes a plate of hope\u2026a light in dark times.\n\n## Nowadays, what\u2019s your dream?\n\nIt is very simple, food is a universal human right. Feeding each other, cooking and eating together, is what makes us human.\n\n---\n\n## Address Book\n\nBethesda Crab House  \n4958 Bethesda Ave, Bethesda, MD 20814\n\nCasa Teresa  \n919 19th St NW, Washington, DC 20006\n\nJaleo  \n480 7th St NW, Washington, DC 20004\n\nminibar  \n855 E St NW, Washington, DC 20004\n\nMoon Rabbit  \n927 F St NW, Washington, DC 20004\n\nReverie  \n3201 Cherry Hill Ln, Washington, DC 20007\n\nThe Bazaar by Jos\u00e9 Andr\u00e9s  \n1100 Pennsylvania Avenue NW, Washington, DC 20004\n\nThe Crab Claw  \n304 Burns St, St Michaels, MD 21663\n\nThe Inn at Little Washington  \n309 Middle St, Washington, VA 22747\n\nNational Portrait Gallery  \n8th St NW & G St NW, Washington, DC 20001\n\nWaldorf Astoria Washington DC  \n1100 Pennsylvania Avenue NW, Washington, DC 20004\n\nZaytinya  \n701 9th St NW, Washington, DC 20001\n\n---\n\nHero image: Jos\u00e9 Andr\u00e9s\n\n---\n\nWritten by **Michael He**\n\nMichael He is Chief of Staff, Editorial for The MICHELIN Guide, North America.
