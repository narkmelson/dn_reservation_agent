    "# 29 Best New Restaurants in the DC Area\n\n## There's never a dull moment in Washington's food scene, but the past year has been especially exciting.\n\n![](https://washingtonian.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/NAMAK030224_0097-scaled-down.png \"NAMAK030224_0097-scaled-down - Washingtonian\")\n\n# 29 Best New Restaurants in the DC Area\n\n## There's never a dull moment in Washington's food scene, but the past year has been especially exciting.\n\n## Afghania\n\n### 2811 M ST., NW\n\nThis [four-month-old Georgetown dining room](https://www.afghaniadc.com/) already feels like it\u2019s been around for years. Credit its owners, the Masroor family, who have been running hit Afghan restaurants\u2014Bistro Aracosia in Palisades, Aracosia in McLean, and Afghan Bistro in Springfield\u2014for a while now. Along with their signature aushak and mantu dumplings filled with leeks or beef, the menu here leans into \u201cAfghan frontier food.\u201d These rugged dishes from Afghanistan\u2019s borderlands include shinwari karahi, a smoky chicken curry ladled over housemade naan and topped with a nest of pickled onions.\n\n![](//washingtonian.com/wp-content/plugins/a3-lazy-load/assets/images/lazy_placeholder.gif \"new-restauarants-divider-3 - Washingtonian\")![](https://washingtonian.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/new-restauarants-divider-3.png \"new-restauarants-divider-3 - Washingtonian\")\n\n![](//washingtonian.com/wp-content/plugins/a3-lazy-load/assets/images/lazy_placeholder.gif \"new-restauarants-divider-3 - Washingtonian\")\n![](https://washingtonian.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/new-restauarants-divider-3.png \"new-restauarants-divider-3 - Washingtonian\")\n![](//washingtonian.com/wp-content/plugins/a3-lazy-load/assets/images/lazy_placeholder.gif \"Aventino-lead-image - Washingtonian\")\n![](https://washingtonian.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Aventino-lead-image.jpg \"Aventino-lead-image - Washingtonian\")\n\n### 4747 Bethesda Ave., Bethesda\n\nMike Friedman and the team from DC\u2019s beloved Red Hen are behind Bethesda\u2019s first smash-hit [destination restaurant](https://aventinocucina.com/) in years. The buzzy round bar at the center of the room turns out easy-drinking refreshers including a grapefruit-and-sparkling-ros\u00e9 spritz, while the kitchen excels with snacks, desserts, and, of course, pastas (go for the zesty lumache, a snail-shaped noodle with rich, guanciale-laden amatriciana sauce). The star dish, though, is a pile of sticky, porchetta-spiced lamb ribs accented with pickled fennel and honey vinegar.\n\n![](//washingtonian.com/wp-content/plugins/a3-lazy-load/assets/images/lazy_placeholder.gif \"new-restauarants-divider-3 - Washingtonian\")![](https://washingtonian.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/new-restauarants-divider-3.png \"new-restauarants-divider-3 - Washingtonian\")\n\n![](//washingtonian.com/wp-content/plugins/a3-lazy-load/assets/images/lazy_placeholder.gif \"new-restauarants-divider-3 - Washingtonian\")\n![](https://washingtonian.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/new-restauarants-divider-3.png \"new-restauarants-divider-3 - Washingtonian\")\n\n![](//washingtonian.com/wp-content/plugins/a3-lazy-load/assets/images/lazy_placeholder.gif \"Almeda-shape-update - Washingtonian\")![](https://washingtonian.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Almeda-shape-update.png \"Almeda-shape-update - Washingtonian\")\n\n![](//washingtonian.com/wp-content/plugins/a3-lazy-load/assets/images/lazy_placeholder.gif \"Almeda-shape-update - Washingtonian\")\n![](https://washingtonian.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Almeda-shape-update.png \"Almeda-shape-update - Washingtonian\")\n\n## Almeda\\*\n\n### 828 Upshur St., NW\n\n![](//washingtonian.com/wp-content/plugins/a3-lazy-load/assets/images/lazy_placeholder.gif \"D85_0315-transparent - Washingtonian\")\n![](https://washingtonian.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/D85_0315-transparent-980x1024.png \"D85_0315-transparent - Washingtonian\")\n\nThe thimble-size Petworth space that has rotated through several very good restaurants\u2014from Himitsu to Magpie and the Tiger to Little Vietnam\u2014is now home to this laid-back [Afro-fusion place](https://www.almedarestaurant.com/) from Little Food Studio owner Danielle Harris. Here\u2019s hoping it sticks around. We love her risotto spin on jollof rice; short ribs fired up with Ethiopian awaze; and a juicy, jerk-style pork tenderloin. The concise menu contains just two desserts, but this isn\u2019t a place to skip the sweets: The coconut crunch cake is heaven.\n\n\\**This restaurant is closing August 31.*\n\n![](//washingtonian.com/wp-content/plugins/a3-lazy-load/assets/images/lazy_placeholder.gif \"new-restauarants-divider-3 - Washingtonian\")![](https://washingtonian.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/new-restauarants-divider-3.png \"new-restauarants-divider-3 - Washingtonian\")\n\n![](//washingtonian.com/wp-content/plugins/a3-lazy-load/assets/images/lazy_placeholder.gif \"new-restauarants-divider-3 - Washingtonian\")\n![](https://washingtonian.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/new-restauarants-divider-3.png \"new-restauarants-divider-3 - Washingtonian\")\n\n## Amparo Fondita\n\n### 2002 P St., NW\n\n![](//washingtonian.com/wp-content/plugins/a3-lazy-load/assets/images/lazy_placeholder.gif \"Amparo_ReyLopez_ForLeadingDC-scaled-down - Washingtonian\")\n![](https://washingtonian.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Amparo_ReyLopez_ForLeadingDC-scaled-down.jpg \"Amparo_ReyLopez_ForLeadingDC-scaled-down - Washingtonian\")\n\nFrom-scratch tortillas, electric salsas, and hype-worthy heirloom beans are just the start at this chic yet soulful [modern-Mexican restaurant](https://amparofondita.com/) in Dupont. Christian Irabi\u00e9n, formerly of Muchas Gracias in Chevy Chase DC, serves fruit-studded ceviches, excellent chiles rellenos, and meatier platters such as cochinita pibil\u2014sour-orange-braised pork shank with mandarin slices and red-onion escabeche that you can assemble into tacos. A cool bonus: The restaurant sells many of its ingredients, including tortillas by the dozen, jars of salsa, and an impressive selection of pantry items with insects.\n\n![](//washingtonian.com/wp-content/plugins/a3-lazy-load/assets/images/lazy_placeholder.gif \"new-restauarants-divider-3 - Washingtonian\")![](https://washingtonian.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/new-restauarants-divider-3.png \"new-restauarants-divider-3 - Washingtonian\")  \n![](//washingtonian.com/wp-content/plugins/a3-lazy-load/assets/images/lazy_placeholder.gif \"Bar-Del-Mont-cropped - Washingtonian\")![](https://washingtonian.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Bar-Del-Mont-cropped-300x136.png \"Bar-Del-Mont-cropped - Washingtonian\")\n\n![](//washingtonian.com/wp-content/plugins/a3-lazy-load/assets/images/lazy_placeholder.gif \"new-restauarants-divider-3 - Washingtonian\")\n![](https://washingtonian.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/new-restauarants-divider-3.png \"new-restauarants-divider-3 - Washingtonian\")\n![](//washingtonian.com/wp-content/plugins/a3-lazy-load/assets/images/lazy_placeholder.gif \"Bar-Del-Mont-cropped - Washingtonian\")\n![](https://washingtonian.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Bar-Del-Mont-cropped-300x136.png \"Bar-Del-Mont-cropped - Washingtonian\")\n\n### 3054 Mount Pleasant St., NW\n\nBecause of this sunny dining room\u2019s pedigree\u2014it\u2019s run by Oliver Pastan and his dad, 2 Amys founder Peter Pastan\u2014you may be thinking everyone standing in line is here for the pizza. And it\u2019s true, the [Neapolitan pies](https://www.bardelmonte.com/) are outstanding: Design your own (there are just four toppings, including prosciutto and arugula) or hold out for one of the nightly pizza specials. But just as important are its bookends: snacks like lemon-spritzed skewers of grilled lamb belly and shoulder, and such desserts as a small but mightily delicious cr\u00e8me caramel.\n\n![](//washingtonian.com/wp-content/plugins/a3-lazy-load/assets/images/lazy_placeholder.gif \"new-restauarants-divider-3 - Washingtonian\")![](https://washingtonian.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/new-restauarants-divider-3.png \"new-restauarants-divider-3 - Washingtonian\")\n\n![](//washingtonian.com/wp-content/plugins/a3-lazy-load/assets/images/lazy_placeholder.gif \"new-restauarants-divider-3 - Washingtonian\")\n![](https://washingtonian.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/new-restauarants-divider-3.png \"new-restauarants-divider-3 - Washingtonian\")\n\n![](//washingtonian.com/wp-content/plugins/a3-lazy-load/assets/images/lazy_placeholder.gif \"Beloved-BBQ-cropped - Washingtonian\")![](https://washingtonian.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Beloved-BBQ-cropped-1024x453.png \"Beloved-BBQ-cropped - Washingtonian\")\n\n![](//washingtonian.com/wp-content/plugins/a3-lazy-load/assets/images/lazy_placeholder.gif \"Beloved-BBQ-cropped - Washingtonian\")\n![](https://washingtonian.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Beloved-BBQ-cropped-1024x453.png \"Beloved-BBQ-cropped - Washingtonian\")\n\n### 200 Massachusetts Ave., NW\n\n![](//washingtonian.com/wp-content/plugins/a3-lazy-load/assets/images/lazy_placeholder.gif \"Love Makoto_Beloved BBQ full table_Mike Fuentes Photography - Washingtonian\")\n![](https://washingtonian.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Love-Makoto_Beloved-BBQ-full-table_Mike-Fuentes-Photography.jpg \"Love Makoto_Beloved BBQ full table_Mike Fuentes Photography - Washingtonian\")\n\nThe coolest steakhouse in town is the swank dining room at the back of the Japanese food hall Love, Makoto. The obsession here is [high-end beef](https://www.lovemakoto.com/), whether Japanese A5 Wagyu or US prime. Diners sear the thinly sliced cuts themselves over a grill atop the table, then dab them with black-garlic soy or citrusy salt. Meanwhile, the kitchen takes care of plenty of the cooking, sending out spicy, herb-packed slaw, a lush fried rice studded with Wagyu short rib, and a sculptural crab-and-avocado salad.\n\n![](//washingtonian.com/wp-content/plugins/a3-lazy-load/assets/images/lazy_placeholder.gif \"new-restauarants-divider-3 - Washingtonian\")![](https://washingtonian.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/new-restauarants-divider-3.png \"new-restauarants-divider-3 - Washingtonian\")\n\n![](//washingtonian.com/wp-content/plugins/a3-lazy-load/assets/images/lazy_placeholder.gif \"new-restauarants-divider-3 - Washingtonian\")\n![](https://washingtonian.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/new-restauarants-divider-3.png \"new-restauarants-divider-3 - Washingtonian\")\n\n## Casa Teresa\n\n### 919 19th St., NW\n\nJos\u00e9 Andr\u00e9s acolyte Ruben Garcia\u2019s [leisurely Spanish restaurant](https://teresadc.com/) is one of the best reasons to visit downtown DC\u2019s Square food hall, which he cofounded. Garcia named the place after his abuela, and he excels with simple, open-fire cooking that\u2019s all about showing off top-quality ingredients with zero frippery. We love kicking back at the bar with a vermouth cocktail and platters of build-your-own tomato bread, plates fanned with jam\u00f3n, and the creamiest croquetas we\u2019ve had in recent memory.\n\n![](//washingtonian.com/wp-content/plugins/a3-lazy-load/assets/images/lazy_placeholder.gif \"new-restauarants-divider-3 - Washingtonian\")![](https://washingtonian.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/new-restauarants-divider-3.png \"new-restauarants-divider-3 - Washingtonian\")\n\n![](//washingtonian.com/wp-content/plugins/a3-lazy-load/assets/images/lazy_placeholder.gif \"new-restauarants-divider-3 - Washingtonian\")\n![](https://washingtonian.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/new-restauarants-divider-3.png \"new-restauarants-divider-3 - Washingtonian\")\n\n![](//washingtonian.com/wp-content/plugins/a3-lazy-load/assets/images/lazy_placeholder.gif \"Chay-Shape-update - Washingtonian\")![](https://washingtonian.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Chay-Shape-update.png \"Chay-Shape-update - Washingtonian\")\n\n![](//washingtonian.com/wp-content/plugins/a3-lazy-load/assets/images/lazy_placeholder.gif \"Chay-Shape-update - Washingtonian\")\n![](https://washingtonian.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Chay-Shape-update.png \"Chay-Shape-update - Washingtonian\")\n\n## Chay\n\n### 6351 Columbia Pike, Falls Church\n\n![](//washingtonian.com/wp-content/plugins/a3-lazy-load/assets/images/lazy_placeholder.gif \"chay-1-cropped - Washingtonian\")\n![](https://washingtonian.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/chay-1-cropped-894x1024.png \"chay-1-cropped - Washingtonian\")\n\nThis [Vietnamese newcomer](https://www.chayrestaurant.com/) has become a popular destination for its spicy beef noodle soup and lemongrass-pepper chicken. The catch? Everything is vegetarian or vegan. Chef Lan Tran makes many of her faux meats out of tofu and vegetables, and the table never seems big enough for everything we want. Don\u2019t miss the banana-leaf-wrapped tapioca dumplings stuffed with carrots, mushrooms, and mung beans, the \u201cclam\u201d dip with rice crackers, and the soy-protein \u201cshaky beef\u201d stir-fried with a sweet soy marinade.\n\n![](//washingtonian.com/wp-content/plugins/a3-lazy-load/assets/images/lazy_placeholder.gif \"new-restauarants-divider-3 - Washingtonian\")![](https://washingtonian.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/new-restauarants-divider-3.png \"new-restauarants-divider-3 - Washingtonian\")\n\n![](//washingtonian.com/wp-content/plugins/a3-lazy-load/assets/images/lazy_placeholder.gif \"new-restauarants-divider-3 - Washingtonian\")\n![](https://washingtonian.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/new-restauarants-divider-3.png \"new-restauarants-divider-3 - Washingtonian\")\n\n## Cucina Morini\n\n### 901 Fourth St., NW\n\n![](//washingtonian.com/wp-content/plugins/a3-lazy-load/assets/images/lazy_placeholder.gif \"CM_CreditNinaPalazzolo-28-scaled-down - Washingtonian\")\n![](https://washingtonian.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/CM_CreditNinaPalazzolo-28-scaled-down.jpg \"CM_CreditNinaPalazzolo-28-scaled-down - Washingtonian\")\n\nThis loud, low-lit Mount Vernon Triangle [spinoff of the Navy Yard fixture Osteria Morini](https://www.cucinamorini.com/) has been packing them in from the start. Seven-dollar martinis\u2014and good ones, available all night at the bar\u2014certainly help. Even more alluring: a seafood-heavy coastal Italian menu from Caruso\u2019s Grocery chef (and Osteria Morini alum) Matt Adler. Some flavors, such as fluke crudo simply dressed with blood orange and olive oil, are elegant and restrained. Others are punchier: Linguine with clams sings with lemon and garlic, and roasted game hen gets a hit of hot honey.\n\n![](//washingtonian.com/wp-content/plugins/a3-lazy-load/assets/images/lazy_placeholder.gif \"new-restauarants-divider-3 - Washingtonian\")![](https://washingtonian.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/new-restauarants-divider-3.png \"new-restauarants-divider-3 - Washingtonian\")\n\n![](//washingtonian.com/wp-content/plugins/a3-lazy-load/assets/images/lazy_placeholder.gif \"new-restauarants-divider-3 - Washingtonian\")\n![](https://washingtonian.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/new-restauarants-divider-3.png \"new-restauarants-divider-3 - Washingtonian\")\n\n![](//washingtonian.com/wp-content/plugins/a3-lazy-load/assets/images/lazy_placeholder.gif \"Almeda-shape-2 - Washingtonian\")![](https://washingtonian.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Almeda-shape-2.png \"Almeda-shape-2 - Washingtonian\")\n\n![](//washingtonian.com/wp-content/plugins/a3-lazy-load/assets/images/lazy_placeholder.gif \"Almeda-shape-2 - Washingtonian\")\n![](https://washingtonian.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Almeda-shape-2.png \"Almeda-shape-2 - Washingtonian\")\n\n## Ellie Bird\n\n### 125 Founders Ave., Falls Church\n\n![](//washingtonian.com/wp-content/plugins/a3-lazy-load/assets/images/lazy_placeholder.gif \"2023_10_12_EllieBird-063-cropped - Washingtonian\")\n![](https://washingtonian.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/2023_10_12_EllieBird-063-cropped.png \"2023_10_12_EllieBird-063-cropped - Washingtonian\")\n\nYuan Tang is a [master of the mash-up](https://www.elliebirdva.com/), combining unexpected flavors in familiar dishes. That might mean a kimchi gazpacho in spring or a pho-inspired French onion soup in fall at this more casual, family-friendly sibling to DC tasting-menu spot Rooster & Owl. (That said, an optional $65 three-course prix fixe is a great way to sample Ellie Bird\u2019s eclectic menu.) Brunch is also worth a visit for mochi waffles or a swirled \u201ctornado\u201d omelet. Kids eat well with slightly elevated versions of chicken tenders and cheesy noodles.\n\n![](//washingtonian.com/wp-content/plugins/a3-lazy-load/assets/images/lazy_placeholder.gif \"new-restauarants-divider-3 - Washingtonian\")![](https://washingtonian.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/new-restauarants-divider-3.png \"new-restauarants-divider-3 - Washingtonian\")\n\n![](//washingtonian.com/wp-content/plugins/a3-lazy-load/assets/images/lazy_placeholder.gif \"new-restauarants-divider-3 - Washingtonian\")\n![](https://washingtonian.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/new-restauarants-divider-3.png \"new-restauarants-divider-3 - Washingtonian\")\n\n## Hedzole\n\n### 5505 Colorado Ave., NW\n\n![](//washingtonian.com/wp-content/plugins/a3-lazy-load/assets/images/lazy_placeholder.gif \"Interior and Food photography for Hedzole Restaurant - Washingtonian\")\n![](https://washingtonian.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Rochalle-Stewart2.jpeg \"Interior and Food photography for Hedzole Restaurant - Washingtonian\")\n\nIt\u2019s a familiar ritual to anyone who regularly grabs a quick workday lunch: Sandwich or bowl? Pick your protein and a side. Add some sauces. Sounds pretty standard, but at this [West African counter spot](https://www.hedzoleafroeats.com/) in 16th Street Heights, these choices are exhilarating. Jollof rice, coconut rice, or waakye (Ghanaian rice and beans)? You can\u2019t go wrong, though the jollof is especially rich and well spiced. Stewed oxtails and salmon are excellent protein options, and plant-based meals are just as rewarding. Dress it all up with accents like tomato gravy and sticky plantains.\n\n![](//washingtonian.com/wp-content/plugins/a3-lazy-load/assets/images/lazy_placeholder.gif \"new-restauarants-divider-3 - Washingtonian\")![](https://washingtonian.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/new-restauarants-divider-3.png \"new-restauarants-divider-3 - Washingtonian\")\n\n![](//washingtonian.com/wp-content/plugins/a3-lazy-load/assets/images/lazy_placeholder.gif \"new-restauarants-divider-3 - Washingtonian\")\n![](https://washingtonian.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/new-restauarants-divider-3.png \"new-restauarants-divider-3 - Washingtonian\")\n\n## El\n\n## Presidente\n\n### 1255 Union St., NE\n\n![](//washingtonian.com/wp-content/plugins/a3-lazy-load/assets/images/lazy_placeholder.gif \"El-Presidente-new-restaurants - Washingtonian\")\n![](https://washingtonian.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/El-Presidente-new-restaurants.jpg \"El-Presidente-new-restaurants - Washingtonian\")\n\nThe most perfect nachos in the area can be found at Stephen Starr\u2019s splashy Union Market [homage to Mexico City](https://www.elpresidentedc.com/). They emerge looking more like a pizza than a messy margarita bar snack, with each chip arranged on a round sheet pan, so every bite gets the right amount of chorizo, melty cheese, pickled onion, and beans. It\u2019s a meal in itself, but don\u2019t let that stop you. Carne asada tacos, a whole fried snapper, and a tostada topped with raw yellow\u00adfin tuna are just as fabulous.\n\n![](//washingtonian.com/wp-content/plugins/a3-lazy-load/assets/images/lazy_placeholder.gif \"new-restauarants-divider-3 - Washingtonian\")![](https://washingtonian.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/new-restauarants-divider-3.png \"new-restauarants-divider-3 - Washingtonian\")\n\n![](//washingtonian.com/wp-content/plugins/a3-lazy-load/assets/images/lazy_placeholder.gif \"new-restauarants-divider-3 - Washingtonian\")\n![](https://washingtonian.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/new-restauarants-divider-3.png \"new-restauarants-divider-3 - Washingtonian\")\n\n## Hiraya\n\n### 1250 H St., NE\n\n![](//washingtonian.com/wp-content/plugins/a3-lazy-load/assets/images/lazy_placeholder.gif \"Hiraya-DC-13-scaled-down - Washingtonian\")\n![](https://washingtonian.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Hiraya-DC-13-scaled-down.jpg \"Hiraya-DC-13-scaled-down - Washingtonian\")\n\nPaolo Dungca\u2019s [modern Filipino restaurant](https://www.hirayadc.com/) is both a casual meetup spot for a pandan latte and a date-night destination. By day, the downstairs cafe serves creative coffee drinks and Filipino breakfast. (Try the sweet, garlicky housemade sausage.)

The place embraces fast-food and casual-chain nostalgia with creations such as the Hot Nug (picture an oversize McDonald\u2019s nugget with Nashville hot glaze) and Chicky Pep No. 2, a chicken-cutlet sandwich with \u201cOG breadstick dust\u201d conjuring the flavors of Olive Garden. No use resisting the Doritos-inspired cool-ranch onion rings, either. Cheeky-geeky cocktails include a clarified orange drink that riffs off Orange Julius and an umami-rich olive-and-MSG martini.\n\n## Afghania\n\n### 2811 M ST., NW\n\nThis four-month-old Georgetown dining room already feels like it\u2019s been around for years.

Along with their signature aushak and mantu dumplings filled with leeks or beef, the menu here leans into \u201cAfghan frontier food.\u201d These rugged dishes from Afghanistan\u2019s borderlands include shinwari karahi, a smoky chicken curry ladled over housemade naan and topped with a nest of pickled onions.\n\n![](//washingtonian.com/wp-content/plugins/a3-lazy-load/assets/images/lazy_placeholder.gif \"new-restauarants-divider-3 - Washingtonian\")![](https://washingtonian.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/new-restauarants-divider-3.png \"new-restauarants-divider-3 - Washingtonian\")\n\n![](//washingtonian.com/wp-content/plugins/a3-lazy-load/assets/images/lazy_placeholder.gif \"new-restauarants-divider-3 - Washingtonian\")\n![](https://washingtonian.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/new-restauarants-divider-3.png \"new-restauarants-divider-3 - Washingtonian\")\n\n## Aventino\n\n### 4747 Bethesda Ave., Bethesda\n\n![](//washingtonian.com/wp-content/plugins/a3-lazy-load/assets/images/lazy_placeholder.gif \"Aventino-lead-image - Washingtonian\")\n![](https://washingtonian.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Aventino-lead-image.jpg \"Aventino-lead-image - Washingtonian\")\n\nMike Friedman and the team from DC\u2019s beloved Red Hen are behind Bethesda\u2019s first smash-hit destination restaurant in years. The buzzy round bar at the center of the room turns out easy-drinking refreshers including a grapefruit-and-sparkling-ros\u00e9 spritz, while the kitchen excels with snacks, desserts, and, of course, pastas (go for the zesty lumache, a snail-shaped noodle with rich, guanciale-laden amatriciana sauce).

And it\u2019s true, the Neapolitan pies are outstanding: Design your own (there are just four toppings, including prosciutto and arugula) or hold out for one of the nightly pizza specials.

The obsession here is high-end beef, whether Japanese A5 Wagyu or US prime. Diners sear the thinly sliced cuts themselves over a grill atop the table, then dab them with black-garlic soy or citrusy salt. Meanwhile, the kitchen takes care of plenty of the cooking, sending out spicy, herb-packed slaw, a lush fried rice studded with Wagyu short rib, and a sculptural crab-and-avocado salad.\n\n![](//washingtonian.com/wp-content/plugins/a3-lazy-load/assets/images/lazy_placeholder.gif \"new-restauarants-divider-3 - Washingtonian\")![](https://washingtonian.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/new-restauarants-divider-3.png \"new-restauarants-divider-3 - Washingtonian\")\n\n![](//washingtonian.com/wp-content/plugins/a3-lazy-load/assets/images/lazy_placeholder.gif \"new-restauarants-divider-3 - Washingtonian\")\n![](https://washingtonian.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/new-restauarants-divider-3.png \"new-restauarants-divider-3 - Washingtonian\")\n\n## Casa Teresa\n\n### 919 19th St., NW\n\nJos\u00e9 Andr\u00e9s acolyte Ruben Garcia\u2019s leisurely Spanish restaurant is one of the best reasons to visit downtown DC\u2019s Square food hall, which he cofounded. Garcia named the place after his abuela, and he excels with simple, open-fire cooking that\u2019s all about showing off top-quality ingredients with zero frippery. We love kicking back at the bar with a vermouth cocktail and platters of build-your-own tomato bread, plates fanned with jam\u00f3n, and the creamiest croquetas we\u2019ve had in recent memory.\n\n![](//washingtonian.com/wp-content/plugins/a3-lazy-load/assets/images/lazy_placeholder.gif \"new-restauarants-divider-3 - Washingtonian\")![](https://washingtonian.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/new-restauarants-divider-3.png \"new-restauarants-divider-3 - Washingtonian\")\n\n![](//washingtonian.com/wp-content/plugins/a3-lazy-load/assets/images/lazy_placeholder.gif \"new-restauarants-divider-3 - Washingtonian\")\n![](https://washingtonian.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/new-restauarants-divider-3.png \"new-restauarants-divider-3 - Washingtonian\")\n\n## Chay\n\n### 6351 Columbia Pike, Falls Church\n\n![](//washingtonian.com/wp-content/plugins/a3-lazy-load/assets/images/lazy_placeholder.gif \"chay-1-cropped - Washingtonian\")\n![](https://washingtonian.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/chay-1-cropped-894x1024.png \"chay-1-cropped - Washingtonian\")\n\nThis Vietnamese newcomer has become a popular destination for its spicy beef noodle soup and lemongrass-pepper chicken. The catch? Everything is vegetarian or vegan. Chef Lan Tran makes many of her faux meats out of tofu and vegetables, and the table never seems big enough for everything we want. Don\u2019t miss the banana-leaf-wrapped tapioca dumplings stuffed with carrots, mushrooms, and mung beans, the \u201cclam\u201d dip with rice crackers, and the soy-protein \u201cshaky beef\u201d stir-fried with a sweet soy marinade.\n\n![](//washingtonian.com/wp-content/plugins/a3-lazy-load/assets/images/lazy_placeholder.gif \"new-restauarants-divider-3 - Washingtonian\")![](https://washingtonian.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/new-restauarants-divider-3.png \"new-restauarants-divider-3 - Washingtonian\")\n\n![](//washingtonian.com/wp-content/plugins/a3-lazy-load/assets/images/lazy_placeholder.gif \"new-restauarants-divider-3 - Washingtonian\")\n![](https://washingtonian.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/new-restauarants-divider-3.png \"new-restauarants-divider-3 - Washingtonian\")\n\n## Cucina Morini\n\n### 901 Fourth St., NW\n\n![](//washingtonian.com/wp-content/plugins/a3-lazy-load/assets/images/lazy_placeholder.gif \"CM_CreditNinaPalazzolo-28-scaled-down - Washingtonian\")\n![](https://washingtonian.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/CM_CreditNinaPalazzolo-28-scaled-down.jpg \"CM_CreditNinaPalazzolo-28-scaled-down - Washingtonian\")\n\nThis loud, low-lit Mount Vernon Triangle spinoff of the Navy Yard fixture Osteria Morini has been packing them in from the start. Seven-dollar martinis\u2014and good ones, available all night at the bar\u2014certainly help. Even more alluring: a seafood-heavy coastal Italian menu from Caruso\u2019s Grocery chef (and Osteria Morini alum) Matt Adler. Some flavors, such as fluke crudo simply dressed with blood orange and olive oil, are elegant and restrained. Others are punchier: Linguine with clams sings with lemon and garlic, and roasted game hen gets a hit of hot honey.\n\n![](//washingtonian.com/wp-content/plugins/a3-lazy-load/assets/images/lazy_placeholder.gif \"new-restauarants-divider-3 - Washingtonian\")![](https://washingtonian.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/new-restauarants-divider-3.png \"new-restauarants-divider-3 - Washingtonian\")\n\n![](//washingtonian.com/wp-content/plugins/a3-lazy-load/assets/images/lazy_placeholder.gif \"new-restauarants-divider-3 - Washingtonian\")\n![](https://washingtonian.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/new-restauarants-divider-3.png \"new-restauarants-divider-3 - Washingtonian\")\n\n## Ellie Bird\n\n### 125 Founders Ave., Falls Church\n\n![](//washingtonian.com/wp-content/plugins/a3-lazy-load/assets/images/lazy_placeholder.gif \"2023_10_12_EllieBird-063-cropped - Washingtonian\")\n![](https://washingtonian.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/2023_10_12_EllieBird-063-cropped.png \"2023_10_12_EllieBird-063-cropped - Washingtonian\")\n\nYuan Tang is a master of the mash-up, combining unexpected flavors in familiar dishes. That might mean a kimchi gazpacho in spring or a pho-inspired French onion soup in fall at this more casual, family-friendly sibling to DC tasting-menu spot Rooster & Owl. (That said, an optional $65 three-course prix fixe is a great way to sample Ellie Bird\u2019s eclectic menu.) Brunch is also worth a visit for mochi waffles or a swirled \u201ctornado\u201d omelet.

Pick your protein and a side. Add some sauces. Sounds pretty standard, but at this West African counter spot in 16th Street Heights, these choices are exhilarating. Jollof rice, coconut rice, or waakye (Ghanaian rice and beans)? You can\u2019t go wrong, though the jollof is especially rich and well spiced. Stewed oxtails and salmon are excellent protein options, and plant-based meals are just as rewarding.

They emerge looking more like a pizza than a messy margarita bar snack, with each chip arranged on a round sheet pan, so every bite gets the right amount of chorizo, melty cheese, pickled onion, and beans. It\u2019s a meal in itself, but don\u2019t let that stop you. Carne asada tacos, a whole fried snapper, and a tostada topped with raw yellow\u00adfin tuna are just as fabulous.\n\n![](//washingtonian.com/wp-content/plugins/a3-lazy-load/assets/images/lazy_placeholder.gif \"new-restauarants-divider-3 - Washingtonian\")![](https://washingtonian.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/new-restauarants-divider-3.png \"new-restauarants-divider-3 - Washingtonian\")\n\n![](//washingtonian.com/wp-content/plugins/a3-lazy-load/assets/images/lazy_placeholder.gif \"new-restauarants-divider-3 - Washingtonian\")\n![](https://washingtonian.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/new-restauarants-divider-3.png \"new-restauarants-divider-3 - Washingtonian\")\n\n## Hiraya\n\n### 1250 H St., NE\n\n![](//washingtonian.com/wp-content/plugins/a3-lazy-load/assets/images/lazy_placeholder.gif \"Hiraya-DC-13-scaled-down - Washingtonian\")\n![](https://washingtonian.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Hiraya-DC-13-scaled-down.jpg \"Hiraya-DC-13-scaled-down - Washingtonian\")\n\nPaolo Dungca\u2019s modern Filipino restaurant is both a casual meetup spot for a pandan latte and a date-night destination.

But Dungca, an alum of Bad Saint and Restaurant Eve, shows off his most interesting cooking in the upstairs dining room, where you can pick between \u00e0 la carte offerings or a seasonal eight-course tasting menu.

Take a cue from the place\u2019s name (translation: \u201cthe good cow\u201d) and head for the burger section of the menu, where hefty patties are done up with Gruy\u00e8re fondue or green-peppercorn/cognac a\u00efoli. Not feeling beef? The kitchen does a nice chicken paillard and salmon rillettes, plus a perfect cr\u00e8me caramel.\n\n![](//washingtonian.com/wp-content/plugins/a3-lazy-load/assets/images/lazy_placeholder.gif \"new-restauarants-divider-3 - Washingtonian\")![](https://washingtonian.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/new-restauarants-divider-3.png \"new-restauarants-divider-3 - Washingtonian\")\n\n![](//washingtonian.com/wp-content/plugins/a3-lazy-load/assets/images/lazy_placeholder.gif \"new-restauarants-divider-3 - Washingtonian\")\n![](https://washingtonian.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/new-restauarants-divider-3.png \"new-restauarants-divider-3 - Washingtonian\")\n\n## Limani\n\n### 670 Wharf St., SW\n\nDC saw a mini trend of upscale Greek restaurant openings in the past year, but Limani sets itself apart with the rare combination of stunning water views and transportive food. In a glass-enclosed structure perched between boats at the Wharf, the dining room serves fish so fresh it needs nothing more than capers and kalamata olive oil to shine. Lobster pasta earns its hefty price tag with the juicy meat of a whole crustacean and a tomato sauce packed with seafood flavor, while the $39 three-course lunch is a solid value.\n\n![](//washingtonian.com/wp-content/plugins/a3-lazy-load/assets/images/lazy_placeholder.gif \"new-restauarants-divider-3 - Washingtonian\")![](https://washingtonian.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/new-restauarants-divider-3.png \"new-restauarants-divider-3 - Washingtonian\")\n\n![](//washingtonian.com/wp-content/plugins/a3-lazy-load/assets/images/lazy_placeholder.gif \"new-restauarants-divider-3 - Washingtonian\")\n![](https://washingtonian.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/new-restauarants-divider-3.png \"new-restauarants-divider-3 - Washingtonian\")\n\n## M\u00e9li\n\n### 1630 Columbia Rd., NW\n\n![](//washingtonian.com/wp-content/plugins/a3-lazy-load/assets/images/lazy_placeholder.gif \"DEB_0211-scaled-down-cropped - Washingtonian\")\n![](https://washingtonian.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/DEB_0211-scaled-down-cropped.jpg \"DEB_0211-scaled-down-cropped - Washingtonian\")\n\nInside, this is one of the odder settings for a restaurant: a sleek condo building\u2019s lobby. But a crying baby passing through is a small price to pay for Mediterranean cooking this good. Spiced, freshly fried pita chips arrive with dips such as the pepper-and-feta htipiti or the harissa-topped hummus; falafel is perfectly crisp and vivid green; and the classic cucumber-tomato-onion salad tastes straight from the farmers market. When it\u2019s warm, the charming, leafy patio is the place to be.\n\n![](//washingtonian.com/wp-content/plugins/a3-lazy-load/assets/images/lazy_placeholder.gif \"new-restauarants-divider-3 - Washingtonian\")![](https://washingtonian.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/new-restauarants-divider-3.png \"new-restauarants-divider-3 - Washingtonian\")\n\n![](//washingtonian.com/wp-content/plugins/a3-lazy-load/assets/images/lazy_placeholder.gif \"new-restauarants-divider-3 - Washingtonian\")\n![](https://washingtonian.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/new-restauarants-divider-3.png \"new-restauarants-divider-3 - Washingtonian\")\n\n## Mita\n\n### 804 V St., NW\n\n![](//washingtonian.com/wp-content/plugins/a3-lazy-load/assets/images/lazy_placeholder.gif \"D85_2591-Edit-scaled-down - Washingtonian\")\n![](https://washingtonian.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/D85_2591-Edit-scaled-down.jpg \"D85_2591-Edit-scaled-down - Washingtonian\")\n\nVegetables put on a show at this plant-based tasting-menu restaurant from chefs Miguel Guerra and Tatiana Mora, formerly of Michelin-starred El Cielo. Choose four ($75), six ($95), or 14 ($150) artistic courses\u2014or go \u00e0 la carte at the bar, which turns out immaculate mezcal cocktails. A hit available whichever menu you opt for: build-your-own arepas with corn-cake variations using plantains or smoked potato, plus tropical peach-palm \u201cbutter,\u201d guac, and a cashew \u201csour cream.\u201d Other favorites include a foamy Andean root-vegetable soup with sweet plantains and fava beans as well as a soy-and-passionfruit-marinated watermelon ceviche.\n\n![](//washingtonian.com/wp-content/plugins/a3-lazy-load/assets/images/lazy_placeholder.gif \"new-restauarants-divider-3 - Washingtonian\")![](https://washingtonian.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/new-restauarants-divider-3.png \"new-restauarants-divider-3 - Washingtonian\")\n\n![](//washingtonian.com/wp-content/plugins/a3-lazy-load/assets/images/lazy_placeholder.gif \"new-restauarants-divider-3 - Washingtonian\")\n![](https://washingtonian.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/new-restauarants-divider-3.png \"new-restauarants-divider-3 - Washingtonian\")\n\n## Moon Rabbit\n\n### 927 F St., NW\n\n![](//washingtonian.com/wp-content/plugins/a3-lazy-load/assets/images/lazy_placeholder.gif \"DSC07513-Enhanced-NR-final - Washingtonian\")\n![](https://washingtonian.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/DSC07513-Enhanced-NR-final.jpg \"DSC07513-Enhanced-NR-final - Washingtonian\")\n\nKevin Tien\u2019s Vietnamese restaurant at the Wharf closed in early 2023 and was reborn in this new, much cooler Penn Quarter space in January. What\u2019s also better than ever: the chef/owner\u2019s cooking, which elegantly channels his Vietnamese-by-way-of-Texas roots. Squid is stuffed with boudin and eggplant pur\u00e9e, while shrimp Thermidor comes draped in a gorgeous lemon sabayon. Another thing we love: personal touches such as framed artwork from Tien\u2019s young son and cocktails named for Taylor Swift songs (Tien is a mega-fan).\n\n![](//washingtonian.com/wp-content/plugins/a3-lazy-load/assets/images/lazy_placeholder.gif \"new-restauarants-divider-3 - Washingtonian\")![](https://washingtonian.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/new-restauarants-divider-3.png \"new-restauarants-divider-3 - Washingtonian\")\n\n![](//washingtonian.com/wp-content/plugins/a3-lazy-load/assets/images/lazy_placeholder.gif \"new-restauarants-divider-3 - Washingtonian\")\n![](https://washingtonian.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/new-restauarants-divider-3.png \"new-restauarants-divider-3 - Washingtonian\")\n\n## Motorkat\n\n### 6939 Laurel Ave., Takoma Park\n\nTakoma Parkers have always gathered at restaurants on the main drag of Carroll Avenue. For a decade, Republic served as the top spot, but it shuttered in late 2022. Last May, the space became Motorkat. (The name is a tribute to a local legend.) The chef? Republic\u2019s own Danny Wells. His kitchen excels with raw-bar options (try the mini lobster roll) and wood-grilled crowd pleasers such as a dry-aged burger. But don\u2019t overlook less expected plates like charred Japanese eggplant with cashew labneh or fried chicken with Madras curry sauce.\n\n![](//washingtonian.com/wp-content/plugins/a3-lazy-load/assets/images/lazy_placeholder.gif \"new-restauarants-divider-3 - Washingtonian\")![](https://washingtonian.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/new-restauarants-divider-3.png \"new-restauarants-divider-3 - Washingtonian\")\n\n![](//washingtonian.com/wp-content/plugins/a3-lazy-load/assets/images/lazy_placeholder.gif \"new-restauarants-divider-3 - Washingtonian\")\n![](https://washingtonian.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/new-restauarants-divider-3.png \"new-restauarants-divider-3 - Washingtonian\")\n\n## Namak\n\n### 1813 Columbia Rd., NW\n\n![](//washingtonian.com/wp-content/plugins/a3-lazy-load/assets/images/lazy_placeholder.gif \"NAMAK030224_0040-scaled-down-cropped - Washingtonian\")\n![](https://washingtonian.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/NAMAK030224_0040-scaled-down-cropped.jpg \"NAMAK030224_0040-scaled-down-cropped - Washingtonian\")\n\nWhat was once the cozy French/American bistro Mintwood Place is now a bright, white-banquette Adams Morgan destination for Persian, Turkish, and Levantine mezze and kebabs. Dips, such as whipped goat cheese with honey or walnut labneh, are the way to start. Then pass around a green-olive salad swirled with pomegranate molasses and fresh herbs, a plate of beautifully crisped zucchini fritters, and a roast half-chicken with lemony potatoes. Cocktails tend to be no-joke strong, but the bar\u2019s riff on a French 75 goes down easy.\n\n![](//washingtonian.com/wp-content/plugins/a3-lazy-load/assets/images/lazy_placeholder.gif \"new-restauarants-divider-3 - Washingtonian\")![](https://washingtonian.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/new-restauarants-divider-3.png \"new-restauarants-divider-3 - Washingtonian\")\n\n![](//washingtonian.com/wp-content/plugins/a3-lazy-load/assets/images/lazy_placeholder.gif \"new-restauarants-divider-3 - Washingtonian\")\n![](https://washingtonian.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/new-restauarants-divider-3.png \"new-restauarants-divider-3 - Washingtonian\")\n\n## Pascual\n\n### 732 Maryland Ave., NE\n\n![](//washingtonian.com/wp-content/plugins/a3-lazy-load/assets/images/lazy_placeholder.gif \"Pascaul-new-restaurants - Washingtonian\")\n![](https://washingtonian.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Pascaul-new-restaurants.jpg \"Pascaul-new-restaurants - Washingtonian\")\n\nIf the Parisian bistro Lut\u00e8ce is the hottest spot in Georgetown, this snug Mexican place\u2014also from chef Matt Conroy and pastry chef Isabel Coss\u2014is the hottest spot in all of DC. If you manage to land a table (best of luck) inside or on the pretty patio, you\u2019ll be rewarded with plates such as a kaleidoscopically flavorful chayote-and-Asian-pear salad, a comforting parsnip tamal with white mole, or a giant, meltingly tender hunk of lamb neck to be folded into warm tortillas. Coss\u2019s desserts are just as winning.\n\n![](//washingtonian.com/wp-content/plugins/a3-lazy-load/assets/images/lazy_placeholder.gif \"new-restauarants-divider-3 - Washingtonian\")![](https://washingtonian.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/new-restauarants-divider-3.png \"new-restauarants-divider-3 - Washingtonian\")\n\n![](//washingtonian.com/wp-content/plugins/a3-lazy-load/assets/images/lazy_placeholder.gif \"new-restauarants-divider-3 - Washingtonian\")\n![](https://washingtonian.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/new-restauarants-divider-3.png \"new-restauarants-divider-3 - Washingtonian\")\n\n## Nue\n\n### 944 W.

But the menu has both style and substance. Pacific Northwest oysters get zing from a fish-sauce/yuzu mignonette granita, ultra-crispy seafood spring rolls come with a garden\u2019s worth of fresh herbs and lettuces for wrapping, and a hearty Vietnamese beef stew is reimagined as short-rib ragu with ribbons of handmade pappardelle.\n\n![](//washingtonian.com/wp-content/plugins/a3-lazy-load/assets/images/lazy_placeholder.gif \"new-restauarants-divider-3 - Washingtonian\")![](https://washingtonian.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/new-restauarants-divider-3.png \"new-restauarants-divider-3 - Washingtonian\")\n\n![](//washingtonian.com/wp-content/plugins/a3-lazy-load/assets/images/lazy_placeholder.gif \"new-restauarants-divider-3 - Washingtonian\")\n![](https://washingtonian.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/new-restauarants-divider-3.png \"new-restauarants-divider-3 - Washingtonian\")\n\n## Petite Cerise\n\n### 1027 Seventh St., NW\n\n![](//washingtonian.com/wp-content/plugins/a3-lazy-load/assets/images/lazy_placeholder.gif \"WSHTNBRUNCH2023_0075-cropped - Washingtonian\")\n![](https://washingtonian.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/WSHTNBRUNCH2023_0075-cropped-1024x895.jpg \"WSHTNBRUNCH2023_0075-cropped - Washingtonian\")\n\nThis Shaw place from Dabney owner Jeremiah Langhorne eschews faux smoke stains, mismatched silverware, and creaky chairs in favor of a different bistro aesthetic: light, airy, and still very French. In the morning, rolled croissants with tufts of meringue are an A-plus grab-and-go breakfast, while lunch and dinner bring savories including grilled asparagus with lemony sauce mousseline and moules frites with saffron cream. Baguettes from Manifest Bakery make everything better, whether onion soup or a classic sandwich filled with ham, Comt\u00e9 cheese, and butter.\n\n![](//washingtonian.com/wp-content/plugins/a3-lazy-load/assets/images/lazy_placeholder.gif \"new-restauarants-divider-3 - Washingtonian\")![](https://washingtonian.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/new-restauarants-divider-3.png \"new-restauarants-divider-3 - Washingtonian\")\n\n![](//washingtonian.com/wp-content/plugins/a3-lazy-load/assets/images/lazy_placeholder.gif \"new-restauarants-divider-3 - Washingtonian\")\n![](https://washingtonian.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/new-restauarants-divider-3.png \"new-restauarants-divider-3 - Washingtonian\")\n\n## Southeast Impression\n\n### 9530 Fairfax Blvd., Fairfax\n\n![](//washingtonian.com/wp-content/plugins/a3-lazy-load/assets/images/lazy_placeholder.gif \"Nasi-Lemak-cropped - Washingtonian\")\n![](https://washingtonian.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Nasi-Lemak-cropped.jpg \"Nasi-Lemak-cropped - Washingtonian\")\n\nThis Fairfax restaurant comes from the rapidly expanding Ivea Restaurant Group (behind Urban Hot Pot, Akira Ramen, and several other local Asian eateries). The traditional Malaysian and Singaporean dishes shine and aren\u2019t easily found elsewhere in the DC area. There\u2019s roti canai, the flaky flatbread; a fragrant mound of Nasi lemak surrounded by fried chicken, anchovies, peanuts, cucumbers, and sambal; and a fiery sambal stir-fry with shrimp and crisp okra. All the Thai hits are here, too, done exceedingly well.\n\n![](//washingtonian.com/wp-content/plugins/a3-lazy-load/assets/images/lazy_placeholder.gif \"new-restauarants-divider-3 - Washingtonian\")![](https://washingtonian.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/new-restauarants-divider-3.png \"new-restauarants-divider-3 - Washingtonian\")\n\n![](//washingtonian.com/wp-content/plugins/a3-lazy-load/assets/images/lazy_placeholder.gif \"new-restauarants-divider-3 - Washingtonian\")\n![](https://washingtonian.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/new-restauarants-divider-3.png \"new-restauarants-divider-3 - Washingtonian\")\n\n## Songbird\n\n### 10940 Fairfax Blvd., Fairfax\n\nGeneral Tso\u2019s chicken often veers syrupy-sweet, but the version at this Chinese American spot boasts a tangy glaze with a kick of heat. The menu is full of old-school classics like moo shu pork and a pupu platter of fried goodies (crab rangoons, crackly shrimp), and the disco-ball-lit bar makes this place all the more fun. Songbird is as much a destination for drinks as for food, whether a jasmine-infused vesper martini or a clear mezcal-and-tequila concoction with cantaloupe and winter melon. Occasional DJs add to the nightlife vibes.\n\n![](//washingtonian.com/wp-content/plugins/a3-lazy-load/assets/images/lazy_placeholder.gif \"new-restauarants-divider-3 - Washingtonian\")![](https://washingtonian.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/new-restauarants-divider-3.png \"new-restauarants-divider-3 - Washingtonian\")\n\n![](//washingtonian.com/wp-content/plugins/a3-lazy-load/assets/images/lazy_placeholder.gif \"new-restauarants-divider-3 - Washingtonian\")\n![](https://washingtonian.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/new-restauarants-divider-3.png \"new-restauarants-divider-3 - Washingtonian\")\n\n![](//washingtonian.com/wp-content/plugins/a3-lazy-load/assets/images/lazy_placeholder.gif \"Truong-Tien - Washingtonian\")![](https://washingtonian.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Truong-Tien-300x160.png \"Truong-Tien - Washingtonian\")\n\n![](//washingtonian.com/wp-content/plugins/a3-lazy-load/assets/images/lazy_placeholder.gif \"Truong-Tien - Washingtonian\")\n![](https://washingtonian.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Truong-Tien-300x160.png \"Truong-Tien - Washingtonian\")\n\n### 6763 Wilson Blvd., Falls Church\n\nTucked into the depths of the Eden Center mall, this gem specializes in Hue-style cooking from the central Vietnamese city once home to emperors. Start with b\u00e1nh b\u00e8o\u2014open-face shrimp-and-chicharr\u00f3n dumplings that you spoon with tangy fish sauce\u2014or tapioca dumplings wrapped in banana leaves. B\u00e1nh kho\u00e1i, crisped taco-size pancakes, come stuffed with shrimp, pork, and bean sprouts and are served with spicy peanut sauce. The restaurant also does a star spicy lemongrass noodle soup with rustic meatballs, pork blood, and other gelatinous bits.\n\n![](//washingtonian.com/wp-content/plugins/a3-lazy-load/assets/images/lazy_placeholder.gif \"new-restauarants-divider-3 - Washingtonian\")![](https://washingtonian.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/new-restauarants-divider-3.png \"new-restauarants-divider-3 - Washingtonian\")\n\n![](//washingtonian.com/wp-content/plugins/a3-lazy-load/assets/images/lazy_placeholder.gif \"new-restauarants-divider-3 - Washingtonian\")\n![](https://washingtonian.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/new-restauarants-divider-3.png \"new-restauarants-divider-3 - Washingtonian\")\n\n## Your Only\n\n## Friend\n\n### 1114 Ninth St., NW\n\n![](//washingtonian.com/wp-content/plugins/a3-lazy-load/assets/images/lazy_placeholder.gif \"YourOnlyFriend_Feb2024_CreditVS-46-cropped - Washingtonian\")\n![](https://washingtonian.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/YourOnlyFriend_Feb2024_CreditVS-46-cropped.jpg \"YourOnlyFriend_Feb2024_CreditVS-46-cropped - Washingtonian\")\n\nSandwiches and cocktails become BFFs at this Shaw takeout shop/bar from Columbia Room alums Paul Taylor and Sherra Kurtz. The place embraces fast-food and casual-chain nostalgia with creations such as the Hot Nug (picture an oversize McDonald\u2019s nugget with Nashville hot glaze) and Chicky Pep No. 2, a chicken-cutlet sandwich with \u201cOG breadstick dust\u201d conjuring the flavors of Olive Garden. No use resisting the Doritos-inspired cool-ranch onion rings, either. Cheeky-geeky cocktails include a clarified orange drink that riffs off Orange Julius and an umami-rich olive-and-MSG martini.\n\n*This article appears in the [July 2024](https://washingtonian.com/2024/06/27/july-2024-best-new-restaurants-2/) issue of Washingtonian.*\n\n![Ann Limpert](//washingtonian.com/wp-content/plugins/a3-lazy-load/assets/images/lazy_placeholder.gif)\n![Ann Limpert](https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/cd3a649e21992f276caedbfbd03877cdb291e5023bb1c853cb07187c9cf3fdaf?s=192&d=mm&r=g)\n\nAnn Limpert joined *Washingtonian* in late 2003.

This is complemented by classic cocktails and chef Rock Harper\u2019s soulful Southern bar food, including shrimp r\u00e9moulade; red beans and rice; and pimiento cheese.\n\n## Kayu\n\n### *location\\_on*1633 17th St., NW.\n\n### *language*[Website](https://kayudc.com/)\n\n![](//washingtonian.com/wp-content/plugins/a3-lazy-load/assets/images/lazy_placeholder.gif \"DSC_2538-scaled-down - Washingtonian\")\n![](https://washingtonian.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/DSC_2538-scaled-down.jpg \"DSC_2538-scaled-down - Washingtonian\")\n\nChef Paolo Dungca\u2019s Filipino tasting room on the H Street corridor closed this summer.

Well, everything. The design anchored by the kitchen\u2019s huge, sparking hearth. The terrific cocktails, such as a refresher conjured from mango, rum, and clarified yogurt. The sharp (but warm!) service. But most of all of course, it\u2019s the food, which has gotten better and better over the restaurant\u2019s five year existence. Rafidi\u2019s family is Palestinian, he grew up in Maryland, and he trained for years under California chef/restaurateur Michael Mina. He synthesizes all of that life experience here (Albi translates to \u201cMy heart\u201d) and channels it into plates that are as visually stunning as they are delicious.\u00a0\n\nRafidi tends to stay behind the scenes, but last year was a huge one for the chef: he won the [James Beard award](https://washingtonian.com/2024/06/10/michael-rafidi-and-masako-morishita-win-big-at-the-2024-james-beard-awards/) for best chef in the country, and he opened two instant-hit Union Market restaurants\u2014his casual cafe [Yellow](https://washingtonian.com/2024/10/25/yellow-cafe-is-adding-a-fancy-fun-evening-kabob-menu-in-union-market/) and his sexy, French/Middle Eastern lounge [La\u2019 Shukran](https://washingtonian.com/2024/09/18/la-shukran-opens-with-a-middle-eastern-take-on-a-french-bistro-and-bar/).

It was the octopus\u2026until the beef-cheek-stuffed cabbage hit the table.\u201d And so on.\n\nIf you\u2019re a lamb lover, Albi should be at the top of your own list, if only for its spectacular barbecue lamb kebab.
