    "[DC](/washington-dc)Guide\n\n# The Best Hotel Restaurants In DC\n\nWhether you\u2019re an overnight guest or just live down the street.\n\nphoto credit: Alhambra\n\n[Madeline Weinfield](/contributor/madeline-weinfield)\n\nHotel restaurants often get overlooked in favor of other heavy-hitters, but writing them off in DC would be a major oversight. There are some seriously good restaurants hidden in the district\u2019s hotels\u2014great news if you\u2019re visiting from out of town and feel like eating in, or a local looking for a change of pace. Here\u2019s where to eat, whichever bucket you fall into.\n\n###### What Our Ratings Mean\n\n[Learn more](/ratings-explainer)\n\nNONE\n\n1-5\n\n6s\n\n7s\n\n8s\n\n9s\n\nUnrated: This is a restaurant we want to re-visit before rating, or it\u2019s a coffee shop, bar, or dessert shop.

That\u2019s reason enough to eat at D\u014dgon, the sleek, impossibly cool restaurant at the Salamander Hotel. D\u014dgon\u2019s Afro-Caribbean menu is one of the most unique we\u2019ve seen in the city\u2014the hoe crab with plantain and the spiced-to-perfection roasted chicken with jollof rice is what we\u2019ll be ordering on repeat. Come here with your hard-to-impress friends from out of town. The dishes are designed to share, generously portioned, decadently rich, and worth valet parking your car for.\n\n[RESERVE A TABLE](https://resy.com/cities/washington-dc/venues/dogon-by-kwame-onwuachi)\n\nScott Suchman\n\n9.4\n\n[## The Bazaar](/washington-dc/reviews/the-bazaar)\n\n[1100 Pennsylvania Ave NW, Washington, D.C. 20004](https://www.google.com/maps/search/?api=1&query=The%20Bazaar+1100 Pennsylvania Ave NW, Washington, D.C. 20004)\n\n$$$$\n\n[Spanish](/washington-dc/cuisines/spanish)\n\n[Penn Quarter](/washington-dc/neighborhoods/penn-quarter)\n\nPerfect For:[Birthdays](/washington-dc/perfect-for/birthdays)[Corporate Cards](/washington-dc/perfect-for/corporate-cards)\n\nIf you have a rich uncle visiting town, this is where you should take him. Located in what was the Waldorf-Astoria hotel, The Bazaar has a white tablecloth vibe and elevated takes on classics, like a deconstructed caesar salad and a pricey rendition of a Philly cheesesteak. It\u2019s a Jos\u00e9 Andr\u00e9s spot, so people come to see and be seen, for special occasions, or when someone else is picking up the tab. But more than any big-name guest, the real star of the show is the jam\u00f3n Ib\u00e9rico, which moves around the dining room on its own cart and is carved by hand tableside.\n\n[RESERVE A TABLE](http://www.opentable.com/r/the-bazaar-by-jose-andres-dc-washington?ref=16825)\n\nRey Lopez\n\n7.8\n\n[## Michele\u2019s](/washington-dc/reviews/micheles)\n\n[1201 K St NW, Washington, D.C. 20005](https://www.google.com/maps/search/?api=1&query=Michele%E2%80%99s+1201 K St NW, Washington, D.C. 20005)\n\n$$$$\n\n[French](/washington-dc/cuisines/french)\n\n[Downtown](/washington-dc/neighborhoods/downtown)\n\nPerfect For:[Night On The Town](/washington-dc/perfect-for/night-on-the-town)[Drinking Great Cocktails](/washington-dc/perfect-for/drinking-great-cocktails)[See & Be Seen](/washington-dc/perfect-for/see-and-be-seen)\n\nMichele\u2019s is perpetually bumping. The loosely French-inspired restaurant gets a visiting crowd thanks to its location in the Eaton DC, but it\u2019s also popular with locals who otherwise come to the hotel for its co-working space and packed event schedule.

While the Jefferson Hotel is popular with foreign dignitaries\u2014some of whom might be eating at the table next to yours\u2014the candlelight, historic fireplace, and tables cordoned off with curtains inspire more romance than business. Regardless of your reason for being here, you\u2019ll want to dress up (your best blazer would fit in well). The menu is mostly fancy classics like scallops, oysters, and squid ink risotto, and while nothing\u2019s revolutionary, everything is prepared exceptionally, and the white tablecloth, classic DC vibe justifies the price tag.\n\n[RESERVE A TABLE](https://www.opentable.com/r/greenhouse-at-the-jefferson-washington-dc?ref=16825)\n\nThe Greenhouse\n\n[## Caf\u00e9 Riggs](/washington-dc/reviews/cafe-riggs)\n\n[900 F St NW, Washington, D.C. 20004](https://www.google.com/maps/search/?api=1&query=Caf%C3%A9%20Riggs+900 F St NW, Washington, D.C. 20004)\n\n$$$$\n\n[American](/washington-dc/cuisines/american)\n\n[Penn Quarter](/washington-dc/neighborhoods/penn-quarter)\n\nPerfect For:[Brunch](/washington-dc/perfect-for/brunch)[Coffee & A Light Bite](/washington-dc/perfect-for/coffee-a-light-bite)[Getting Work Done](/washington-dc/perfect-for/getting-work-done)\n\nIf hotel restaurants were entrants in a beauty pageant, Caf\u00e9 Riggs would win the looks category hands down. This all-day-restaurant has architectural bones, a pastel palette, and soaring ceilings, and we love that the historic bank building (now the Riggs Hotel) retains its character with original teller windows and a bank vault. It all makes for a grand setting for a perfectly presented brunch with out-of-town guests. Caf\u00e9 Riggs is also a stylish post-work spot, and great for a cocktail after a visit to the National Portrait Gallery across the street.\n\n[RESERVE A TABLE](https://www.sevenrooms.com/reservations/caferiggs)\n\nCaf\u00e9 Riggs\n\n[## Blue Duck Tavern](/washington-dc/reviews/blue-duck-tavern)\n\n[1201 24th St NW, Washington, D.C. 20037](https://www.google.com/maps/search/?api=1&query=Blue%20Duck%20Tavern+1201 24th St NW, Washington, D.C. 20037)\n\n$$$$\n\n[American](/washington-dc/cuisines/american)\n\n[Georgetown](/washington-dc/neighborhoods/georgetown)\n\nPerfect For:[Brunch](/washington-dc/perfect-for/brunch)[Date Nights](/washington-dc/perfect-for/date-night)[Fine Dining](/washington-dc/perfect-for/fine-dining)\n\nAt first glance, Blue Duck Tavern in the Grand Hyatt might look like the kind of place where serious deals are made over a few martinis. However, the quality of their menu is the real reason people come here\u2014bring some dining companions who are impressed by steak, caviar, and bone marrow. Ordering a la carte is great for a quicker meal, but every now and then we like to go all the way with the ten course tasting menu. Ask for a table near the open kitchen, because watching the expert tweezer work of the chefs is excellent dinner theater.\n\n[RESERVE A TABLE](https://www.exploretock.com/blueducktavern?utm_source=infatuation)\n\nBlue Duck Tavern\n\n[## Le Sel](/washington-dc/reviews/le-sel)\n\n[1315 16th St NW, Washington, D.C. 20036](https://www.google.com/maps/search/?api=1&query=Le%20Sel+1315 16th St NW, Washington, D.C. 20036)\n\n$$$$\n\n[French](/washington-dc/cuisines/french)\n\n[Dupont Circle](/washington-dc/neighborhoods/dupont-circle)\n\nPerfect For:[Brunch](/washington-dc/perfect-for/brunch)[Casual Dinners](/washington-dc/perfect-for/casual-dinners)[Walk-Ins](/washington-dc/perfect-for/walk-ins)\n\nFinding a table for brunch in Dupont Circle without a reservation should be an Olympic Sport, and although we can\u2019t guaranteeyou a coveted mid-morning seat, you have a pretty good chance of having a Bloody Mary in hand within a few minutes of walking into Le Sel. The Kimpton Banneker Hotel\u2019s restaurant is a solidly reliable place to grab brunch when you haven\u2019t made reservations or don\u2019t feel like waiting a long time for a table. And don\u2019t overthink it\u2014French staples like pain perdu and croque monsieur with a side of frites is what it\u2019s all about.\n\n[RESERVE A TABLE](https://resy.com/cities/washington-dc/venues/le-sel)\n\n[## No Goodbyes](/washington-dc/reviews/no-goodbyes)\n\n[1770 Euclid St NW, Washington, D.C. 20009](https://www.google.com/maps/search/?api=1&query=No%20Goodbyes+1770 Euclid St NW, Washington, D.C. 20009)\n\n$$$$\n\n[American](/washington-dc/cuisines/american)\n\n[Adams Morgan](/washington-dc/neighborhoods/adams-morgan)\n\nPerfect For:[First Dates](/washington-dc/perfect-for/first-dates)[Drinks & A Light Bite](/washington-dc/perfect-for/drinks-a-light-bite)[People Watching](/washington-dc/perfect-for/people-watching)\n\nYou probably haven\u2019t had a date in a church before, but there\u2019s a first time for everything. This restaurant and bar at the Line Hotel was a church before it became an \u201cit\u201d spot in Adams Morgan. The people watching is great\u2014not one baggy suit in sight\u2014and the large original windows offer stunning views of the neighborhood. Grab a seat beneath the soaring vaulted arches and munch on small plates like raw local oysters, shoestring fries, and a pickled vegetable platter.

Cut feels like a movie version of a hotel steakhouse\u2014sleek decor and low lighting complement the deal makers and dates, complete with clinking martini glasses and sharp knives slicing into expertly cooked cuts of filet mignon, wagyu, and rib eye. Don\u2019t be discouraged if you\u2019re dining with (or are yourself) a non-meat eater\u2014Cut\u2019s bluefin tuna tartare on crispy rice is satisfying enough to keep anyone coming back.\n\n[RESERVE A TABLE](https://www.opentable.com/r/cut-by-wolfgang-puck-washington-district-of-columbia?ref=16825)\n\n[## Alhambra](/washington-dc/reviews/alhambra)\n\n[923 Black Lives Matter Plaza NW, Washington, District of Columbia 20006](https://www.google.com/maps/search/?api=1&query=Alhambra+923 Black Lives Matter Plaza NW, Washington, District of Columbia 20006)\n\n$$$$\n\n[Mediterranean](/washington-dc/cuisines/mediterranean)\n\n[Downtown](/washington-dc/neighborhoods/downtown)\n\nPerfect For:[Date Nights](/washington-dc/perfect-for/date-night)[Corporate Cards](/washington-dc/perfect-for/corporate-cards)[People Watching](/washington-dc/perfect-for/people-watching)\n\nThe bar at the St. Regis Hotel is almost always crowded, yet the hotel\u2019s restaurant, Alhambra, is rarely anywhere near full. We love coming here for a weekday dinner when the dining room feels ultra-intimate\u2014there are even booths with curtains for added privacy. This is a place for trading state secrets or telling someone you love them over a menu of mostly small, shareable plates. Get the crab croquettes served with jamon serrano and the smoked eggplant mousse topped with dates and pomegranates, and end the meal with the tableside tiramisu.\n\n[RESERVE A TABLE](https://www.opentable.com/r/alhambra-washington?ref=16825)\n\nAlhambra\n\n[## Estuary](/washington-dc/reviews/estuary-dc)\n\n[950 New York Ave NW, Washington, D.C. 20001](https://www.google.com/maps/search/?api=1&query=Estuary+950 New York Ave NW, Washington, D.C. 20001)\n\n$$$$\n\n[American](/washington-dc/cuisines/american)\n\n[Penn Quarter](/washington-dc/neighborhoods/penn-quarter)\n\nPerfect For:[Late Nights](/washington-dc/perfect-for/late-nights)[Night On The Town](/washington-dc/perfect-for/night-on-the-town)[Drinking Great Cocktails](/washington-dc/perfect-for/drinking-great-cocktails)[Drinks & A Light Bite](/washington-dc/perfect-for/drinks-a-light-bite)\n\nThe city somehow seems bigger than it actually is when looking through Estuary\u2019s floor-to-ceiling glass windows. Maybe it\u2019s because the restaurant, on a high floor of the Conrad Hotel, is itself massive, so much so that you\u2019re practically guaranteed a seat anytime of night. But it\u2019s a bar stool we come for, especially to begin or end a night downtown. Estuary walks the line between serving comforting late night (until 12am) snacks like chicken tenders and shrimp cocktail and elegant, DC-themed drinks.

The historic Italian enclaves like [Adams Morgan](https://www.theinfatuation.com/washington-dc/guides/best-restaurants-bars-adams-morgan-dc) may have introduced the city to creamy risotto, juicy ragu, and coffee-soaked tiramisu, but you can find great Italian all around town\u2014and this guide is here to prove it. Here are the chicken parms that inspire bipartisanship, spaghetti that saves relationships, and lasagnas that provide emotional support in times of need.\n\n###### What Our Ratings Mean\n\n[Learn more](/ratings-explainer)\n\n7s\n\n8s\n\n9s\n\nUnrated: This is a restaurant we want to re-visit before rating, or it\u2019s a coffee shop, bar, or dessert shop.

The focaccia di formaggio for the table is an ideal icebreaker, with savory crescenza cheese that oozes out with each stretch of the bread. The fritto misto is an addictive medley of lightly fried anchovies, prawns, and calamari, topped with a zesty lemon squeeze, which tastes like summers spent hopping from one coastal Italian seafood shack to another (or so we\u2019d imagine). If you\u2019re inclined to recreate the spaghetti smooch from *Lady and the Tramp*, spring for the classic spaghetti al pomodoro.\n\n[RESERVE A TABLE](https://resy.com/cities/washington-dc/venues/ama-dc)\n\nGiada Paoloni\n\n[## Centrolina](/washington-dc/reviews/centrolina-dc)\n\n[974 Palmer Alley NW, Washington, D.C. 20001](https://www.google.com/maps/search/?api=1&query=Centrolina+974 Palmer Alley NW, Washington, D.C. 20001)\n\n$$$$\n\n[Italian](/washington-dc/cuisines/italian)\n\n[Downtown](/washington-dc/neighborhoods/downtown)\n\nPerfect For:[Date Nights](/washington-dc/perfect-for/date-night)[Special Occasions](/washington-dc/perfect-for/special-occasions)[Impressing Out of Towners](/washington-dc/perfect-for/impressing-out-of-towners)\n\nSmack dab in the hyperluxury of CityCenter, Centrolina delivers Italian cooking with enough polish to fit in with its well-heeled neighbors. With a fireplace and buttery light surrounded by lots of marble and right angles, it manages to feel luxurious yet welcoming. Come here dressed to the nines for a five-course dinner, or post up at the bar in your best blue jeans for a cocktail and focaccia so light it might float off the table. There\u2019s lots of loveliness across the seasonally-rotating menu, like the roasted porcini mushrooms drenched in rosemary-infused butter broth, but the real reason to come to Centrolina are the pastas. Springy squid ink bucatini arrives coated in a lush tomato-eggplant ragu that demands you pause your dinner conversation, no matter how lively, in order to close your eyes and sigh contentedly.\n\n[RESERVE A TABLE](http://www.opentable.com/r/centrolina?ref=16825)\n\nNina Palazzolo\n\n[## Caruso\u2019s Grocery](/washington-dc/reviews/carusos-grocery)\n\n[914 14th St SE, Washington, District of Columbia 20003](https://www.google.com/maps/search/?api=1&query=Caruso%E2%80%99s%20Grocery+914 14th St SE, Washington, District of Columbia 20003)\n\n$$$$\n\n[Italian](/washington-dc/cuisines/italian)\n\n[Capitol Hill](/washington-dc/neighborhoods/capitol-hill)\n\nPerfect For:[Dinner with the Parents](/washington-dc/perfect-for/dinner-with-the-parents)[Date Nights](/washington-dc/perfect-for/date-night)\n\nDining at this Italian restaurant in Capitol Hill feels like entering a world where bad days don\u2019t exist. Diners are snugly packed into tomato-red cushioned booths, trading in the day's passive aggressive emails for zesty lemon-butter chicken piccata and rich and velvety blood orange cr\u00e8me br\u00fbl\u00e9es. The restaurant is always bustling with regulars who know to book weeks in advance so as to not get stuck eating dinner at 9:30pm. But it doesn\u2019t really matter when you eat\u2014or what you eat, because each bowl of truffle butter alfredo and spicy seafood tagliatelle is here to remind you that while not every problem has a solution, pasta is always there to make it just a little better.\n\n### How to get into Caruso\u2019s Grocery\n\nReservations should be made at least three weeks in advance for prime-time tables during the week, and a month out for the weekend.

The espresso program is excellent, as are the bread and pastries, which are baked in-house in full view of the dining room. The all-day menu is ideal for sharing, with pizzas that come out of the wood-fired oven beautifully blistered without overly blackening, and sandwiches that can easily satiate the hangry with just a half. While it\u2019s nice to enjoy Piccolina with company, we suggest keeping the sandwiches all to yourself, enjoying half right away and saving the rest for later, particularly the porchetta, which gets better as it sits.\n\nScott Suchman\n\n[## Cucina Morini](/washington-dc/reviews/cucina-morini)\n\n[901 Fourth St NW, Washington, District of Columbia 20001](https://www.google.com/maps/search/?api=1&query=Cucina%20Morini+901 Fourth St NW, Washington, District of Columbia 20001)\n\n$$$$\n\n[Italian](/washington-dc/cuisines/italian)\n\n[Mt.

And while we thoroughly enjoy the new Mt. Vernon Triangle spot, its dinner menu won\u2019t be dethroning Caruso\u2019s anytime soon. But their breakfast? That\u2019s where the magic happens. The sit-down dining room transforms into a light and airy caf\u00e9, and the evening\u2019s fanciness gets tossed out the window. You pick a table, grab your own utensils, and scan a QR code to order. Make sure that includes a bunch of bread-based dishes, like the smoked salmon toast, the avocado sandwich, and at least one cornetto.\n\nCucina Morini\n\n7.8\n\n[## Osteria Al Volo](/washington-dc/reviews/osteria-al-volo)\n\n[1790 Columbia Rd NW, Washington, DC 20009](https://www.google.com/maps/search/?api=1&query=Osteria%20Al%20Volo+1790 Columbia Rd NW, Washington, DC 20009)\n\n$$$$\n\n[Italian](/washington-dc/cuisines/italian)\n\n[Adams Morgan](/washington-dc/neighborhoods/adams-morgan)\n\nPerfect For:[Casual Dinners](/washington-dc/perfect-for/casual-dinners)\n\nOsteria Al Volo\u2019s faded gray awning is easily overlooked, tucked beside a taqueria with the world\u2019s largest and brightest neon sign. But make the effort to find it, because once you step inside, the smell of freshly baked bread, garlic, and olive oil will make the search worthwhile. The kitchen sits in the center of the room and acts like one giant diffuser, filling the space with the scent of endless short rib and ravioli. The cozy spot is great for laid-back hangouts, and the long wooden table in the back is ideal for large group get-togethers. The standing menu is full of classics like cacio e pepe and spaghetti carbonara, but it\u2019s the restaurant\u2019s weekly specials, like their saucy and tenderly braised duck ragu, that keep us coming back.\n\nOsteria Al Volo\n\n7.7\n\n[## L\u2019Ardente](/washington-dc/reviews/lardente)\n\n[200 Massachusetts Ave NW, Washington, D.C. 20001](https://www.google.com/maps/search/?api=1&query=L%E2%80%99Ardente+200 Massachusetts Ave NW, Washington, D.C. 20001)\n\n$$$$\n\n[Italian](/washington-dc/cuisines/italian)\n\n[East End](/washington-dc/neighborhoods/east-end)\n\nPerfect For:[Special Occasions](/washington-dc/perfect-for/special-occasions)[Corporate Cards](/washington-dc/perfect-for/corporate-cards)[Date Nights](/washington-dc/perfect-for/date-night)[Impressing Out of Towners](/washington-dc/perfect-for/impressing-out-of-towners)\n\nL\u2019Ardente is one of DC\u2019s poshest restaurants, so naturally, securing a reservation at the Italian spot in the East End is hard. But you won\u2019t regret hunting on Resy two weeks in advance once you taste their 40-layer lasagna. Slide into a teal booth seat in the gold and white dining room with floor-to-very-high-ceiling windows, and order the buttery dish, rich in truffle and cheese, and full of tender short ribs.

Made in-house and cooked just shy of al dente, they come cloaked in sauces that have been taken very, *very* seriously.

This is our guide to the best date night spots in DC, whether you\u2019re planning a first date with someone you\u2019ve only met digitally, nursing that year-long casual stage, or just want to spend some quality time with the person who splits your internet bill.

The newest restaurant from Kwame Onwuachi is tucked in the lobby of the Salamander hotel on the Southwest Waterfront, and it\u2019s as romantic as it gets. Soft R&B plays in the background, and large pillars give way to little intimate nooks where you and your significant other can split plates of smoky, charred wagyu short rib and some tangy BBQ greens.\n\n### How to get into D\u014dgon\n\nReservations are tough to secure, even weeks in advance, but you can score a walk-in seat and full menu service at the compact bar for up to two guests in a party.

The $195 tasting is served with piping hot pita that might be the best in the city, and if they give you the lettuce wraps with the carrot and tuna pastes, savor the crispy, flavorful goodness. If you want to be *really* impressive, book your dinner at the chef\u2019s table and watch it get cooked over the wood-burning hearth.\n\n### How to get into Albi\n\nReservations open a month in advance, and that's when you should book if you want to avoid the early bird 5pm dinner slot.

This is all to say that Bresca is fun, and the sort of place that's just as suited to celebrating anniversaries that end in a \"0\" as it is an impromptu date night.

The menu, which leans heavily into Mexican cuisine (tacos and mole are stars), steers without warning into Bulgarian and Japanese flavors, with some phyllo dough here and some miso paste there. The upscale [Union Market](https://www.theinfatuation.com/washington-dc/guides/best-dishes-union-market) space seems to be more straightforward, playing into the industrial-chic nature of the building, with high ceilings, glass walls, and exposed pipes. But then, as if taking a cue from the menu, the unexpected comes into view: Eunoia isn\u2019t just a restaurant, it\u2019s also a Pilates studio. It is, admittedly, a bit weird.

Options include a turkey club, shrimp cocktail, and some of the best mozzarella sticks we\u2019ve ever had, thinly breaded with almost no grease. There\u2019s also a $25 burger with a perfectly seasoned, nearly two-inch-thick patty. The place hits capacity early and stays that way through most weekend nights, but even on school nights most bar seats are filled by off-shift hospitality workers.

But while Maison Bar \u00e0 Vins bills itself as a wine bar, the food alone is worth a visit. The smoked eel croquettes, exceptionally creamy and topped with a thin sliver of singed eel, are a standout. For something more substantial, the brioche stuffed chicken is theoretically big enough to share, but the crunchy brioche and buttery chanterelle mushrooms could turn the most communal-minded diner into a food hoarder.\n\n[RESERVE A TABLE](https://resy.com/cities/washington-dc/venues/maison)\n\nDeb Lindsey\n\n[## (H)ours At Manifest 002](/washington-dc/reviews/manifest-002)\n\n[1242 Third St NE, Washington, District of Columbia 20002](https://www.google.com/maps/search/?api=1&query=(H)ours%20At%20Manifest%20002+1242 Third St NE, Washington, District of Columbia 20002)\n\n$$$$\n\n[Fusion](/washington-dc/cuisines/fusion)\n\n[Union Market](/washington-dc/neighborhoods/union-market)\n\nPerfect For:[Date Nights](/washington-dc/perfect-for/date-night)[Impressing Out of Towners](/washington-dc/perfect-for/impressing-out-of-towners)[First Dates](/washington-dc/perfect-for/first-dates)[See & Be Seen](/washington-dc/perfect-for/see-and-be-seen)[Drinking Great Cocktails](/washington-dc/perfect-for/drinking-great-cocktails)\n\n(H)ours At Manifest 002 bucks DC stereotypes.

The restaurant is attached to a members club that also includes a barber shop, cafe, retail store, and more.

That mishmash of design choices makes sense in a restaurant whose menu traces the Silk Road, serving up dishes like falafel topped with slivered ginger, khachapuri filled with steaming goat feta, and lamb sliders with sumac and jalapenos.

Yes, you can still splurge on the $180 omakase, but the \u00e0 la carte menu makes it just as easy to have a good time. The lightly spicy tuna roll has just enough crunch, while the eel nigiri is good enough to tempt an all-eel order (a true chaos move, but do you). Set in a quiet basement with a dining room that opens onto a courtyard filled with bistro tables, the vibe at Sushi Gaku exists somewhere between private club and cozy hangout, and is as suited to last-minute business dinners on the corporate card as it is a low-key date night.\n\n[RESERVE A TABLE](https://tables.toasttab.com/restaurants/da52ffef-cb4b-43ea-b624-7ae24714ecc2/reserve)\n\nSushi Gaku\n\n[## Cafe Fiorello](/washington-dc/reviews/cafe-fiorello-dc)\n\n[1001 Pennsylvania Ave NW, Washington, District of Columbia 20004](https://www.google.com/maps/search/?api=1&query=Cafe%20Fiorello+1001 Pennsylvania Ave NW, Washington, District of Columbia 20004)\n\n$$$$\n\n[Italian](/washington-dc/cuisines/italian)\n\n[Downtown](/washington-dc/neighborhoods/downtown)\n\nPerfect For:[Date Nights](/washington-dc/perfect-for/date-night)[Casual Dinners](/washington-dc/perfect-for/casual-dinners)\n\nThe first thing you should do at Caf\u00e9 Fiorello is order a martini.

The Italian American restaurant has been a [New York City institution](https://www.theinfatuation.com/new-york/reviews/cafe-fiorello) since 1974, and the DC outpost has captured the spirit of the original.\u00a0It\u2019s easy to get swept up in the beauty of Fiorello\u2019s pastas (their peppery spaghetti carbonara is shockingly rich, and exactly what we crave on a cold evening). But the eggplant parmesan is the star of the menu. Their version takes up an entire dinner plate, and while this is a dish that usually makes us want to go take a nap, Fiorello\u2019s version is lighter thanks to the fact that the eggplant is baked rather than breaded and fried.\n\n[RESERVE A TABLE](https://www.opentable.com/r/cafe-fiorello-dc-washington?ref=16825)\n\n[## My Little Chamomile](/washington-dc/reviews/my-little-chamomile)\n\n[3210 Cherry Hill Ln NW, Washington, District of Columbia 20007](https://www.google.com/maps/search/?api=1&query=My%20Little%20Chamomile%20+3210 Cherry Hill Ln NW, Washington, District of Columbia 20007)\n\n$$$$\n\n[Turkish](/washington-dc/cuisines/turkish)\n\n[Georgetown](/washington-dc/neighborhoods/georgetown)\n\nPerfect For:[Casual Dinners](/washington-dc/perfect-for/casual-dinners)[Date Nights](/washington-dc/perfect-for/date-night)\n\nMy Little Chamomile is a Turkish restaurant from the team behind [Green Almond Pantry](https://www.theinfatuation.com/washington-dc/reviews/green-almond-pantry).

The vegetable-forward menu works best shared, and the smallish portions make it easy to skip around. If tomatoes are still in season, start with the super fresh coban salatas\u0131. Otherwise, the\u00a0girit ezmesi, an overload of feta, labneh, and goat cheese whipped together and dusted with pistachios, or the dedemin biberi, anaheim peppers marinated in vinegar and garlic with just enough kick to make them interesting, both make great ice breakers. For something more substantial, we love the mant\u0131 beef dumplings with yogurt.

Opened by the folks at Artfarm, the hospitality arm of the global gallery Hauser & Wirth, the sweeping 180-seat seafood spot takes some inspiration from the gallery, with a massive installation of floating fish sculpted from North Carolina wisteria and Scottish willow. While Fish Shop's roots are Scottish, its menu is decidedly mid-Atlantic, built around what\u2019s fresh from the Chesapeake Bay, Rappahannock River, Atlantic Ocean, and local farms. Think small bites like Maryland crab crumpets and New Jersey squid, as well as hearty mains like Maryland blue crab conchiglie and grilled New Jersey mackerel.

The obvious move at Elmina, from celebrity chef Eric Adjepong, is to come for a birthday, anniversary, or some other occasion that warrants a nice shirt and planning ahead. And while it\u2019s great for that, we also love to come here on a whim and sit at the bar for the more casual a la carte menu, where you can get bites like okra fries, octopus kebabs with a shito glaze, or a hamachi collar with plantain chips.\n\n[EXCLUSIVE RESERVATIONS](https://www.opentable.com/sapphire-reserve-exclusive-tables) AT THIS SPOT WITH\n\n[RESERVE A TABLE](https://www.opentable.com/r/elmina-washington?ref=16825)\n\nElmina\n\n[## Osteria Mozza](/washington-dc/reviews/osteria-mozza-dc)\n\n[3276 M St NW, Washington DC, 20007](https://www.google.com/maps/search/?api=1&query=Osteria%20Mozza+3276 M St NW, Washington DC, 20007)\n\n$$$$\n\n[Italian](/washington-dc/cuisines/italian)\n\n[Georgetown](/washington-dc/neighborhoods/georgetown)\n\nEighteen years after Nancy Silverton opened [Osteria Mozza](https://www.theinfatuation.com/los-angeles/reviews/osteria-mozza) in LA, the iconic Italian restaurant has arrived in [Georgetown](https://www.theinfatuation.com/washington-dc/guides/georgetown-restaurants).

It's not just about longevity or good food\u2014a lot of classics are endearingly imperfect. They can have great oysters but bad lighting, average half-smokes and an amazing history. No, something as special as a classic restaurant needs more than a lengthy relationship with the utilities company. At its most basic, a true institution should make youfeel some connection to the city you can't get in other places. If it can do that, well, then, that's what makes it a stone-cold classic. These are DC\u2019s best.\n\n###### What Our Ratings Mean\n\n[Learn more](/ratings-explainer)\n\n7s\n\n8s\n\n9s\n\nUnrated: This is a restaurant we want to re-visit before rating, or it\u2019s a coffee shop, bar, or dessert shop.
