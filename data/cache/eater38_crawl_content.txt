# The 38 Best Restaurants Around D.C.

The essential restaurants that define the nation’s capital, according to Eater editors

by [Tierney Plumb](https://www.eater.com/authors/tierney-plumb) and [Emily Venezky](https://www.eater.com/authors/emily-venezky)

Updated

The Eater 38 is the ultimate guide to restaurants that define a city’s dining scene. Eater’s editors, who are constantly eating out and checking in with restaurant industry insiders, compile this list every quarter to update it with the essential restaurants you need to know about in this moment. As always, we ensure the list includes a diverse range of cuisines, prices, and neighborhoods in the D.C. area.

In this latest refresh, we’ve revamped our write-ups to include even more relevant info for diners, including a rough range of pricing for each destination — ranging from $ for quick, inexpensive meals with dishes largely under $10, to $$$$ for places where entrees exceed $30.

**New to the map in this fall 2025 update:** **Elmina**, [for West African dishes by a *Top Chef* star](/2025/2/20/24368681/celebrity-chef-eric-adjepong-elmina-dc-restaurant-openings), **Tapori**, [for excellent Indian street foods](/2025/2/25/24371678/tapori-funky-oasis-southeast-asian-street-food-h-street-dc-restaurant-openings) from the H Street team behind Daru, **Occidental**, for a [reimagined downtown classic courtesy](/2025/3/7/24379939/occidental-dc-stephen-starr-opening) of Stephen Starr; and **Fish Shop**, [for stellar seafood set](/2025/4/24/24415818/uk-fish-shop-washington-dc-opening-wharf) to Southwest Waterfront views. And for this round, we’ve trimmed St. James, Rasika, and Melina.

## J. Hollinger's Waterman's Chophouse

**Open for:** Dinner and AYCE Sunday brunch

**Price range:** $$

Restaurateur Jerry Hollinger ([the Daily Dish](/venue/29375/the-daily-dish-a-restaurant-catering-company) and the Dish & Dram) delivered to downtown Silver Spring an Art Deco-styled American chophouse and raw bar celebrating local farmers, watermen, and purveyors. Shrimp and pork belly toast adorned with homemade kimchi are good ways to start; follow those with Rohan duck confit, homemade spinach ricotta ravioli, or anything from the luxe lineup of steaks. Augment dishes with underwater add-ons like butter-poached crab, lobster, jumbo shrimp, and fried oysters. A whale of a deal is in store during happy hour (4 p.m. to close and all night on Tuesdays), when oysters are just $1, and a robust bar program stars New York Sours and fig-sage rye cocktails.

**Vibe check:** The throwback space near the Fillmore takes tips from Sinatra’s era.

**Price range:** $$

One of the newest spots from Italian hitmaker Mike Friedman, known for [Red Hen](/2021/1/14/22230739/red-hen-pivot-regional-italian-pop-ups-coronavirus-takeout-delivery-d-c) and [All-Purpose](/2018/3/21/17148650/all-purpose-navy-yard-opening), [landed](/2024/1/23/24048157/roman-cuisine-bethesda-ap-pizza-aventino-mike-friedman-dc-restaurant-openings) in Bethesda in January 2024 with dishes that evoke the longstanding culinary traditions of Rome and Italy’s Lazio region. The sprawling emerald- and gold-covered dining room transports diners with airy pizza rossa, light salads like the citrus and fennel-filled agrumi, and fantastic pastas that steal the show. House-made dried pastas make up classic Roman dishes, like creamy cacio e pepe and all’amatriciana zipped up with Calabrian chiles. But there are more experimental bowls on the menu as well, like a springtime toothsome cavatelli with a crushed broccoli and ricotta sauce and toasted almond-chile crunch on top. Don’t miss out on dessert options like a chocolate torte balanced with blood orange and earl grey gelato or affogato served with an Italian butter cookie and Madagascar vanilla gelato.

**Best for**: A spritz-fueled happy hour, especially with spritz and pasta pairings for $22 from 5 to 6 p.m. Monday through Thursday at the bar.

Beef ribs, pulled pork, sliced turkey, and St. Louis-style ribs are all available, while daily specials like brisket tacos, lamb ribs, pastrami sandwiches, and barbecue pupusas give the kitchen a creative outlet, and González and Portillo excitingly nod to their [Salvadoran heritage](/2021/12/8/22811842/2fifty-texas-bbq-dc-restaurant-history) in sides like red kidney beans braised with brisket and coleslaw interspersed with raisins.

## Thip Khao

**Open for:** Dinner only

**Price range:** $$

Considered the standard-bearer for Lao cuisine in D.C., Thip Khao comes from mother-and-son chefs Seng Luangrath and Boby Pradachith. Their Columbia Heights standby continues to satisfy heat-seekers with a menu full of fermented fish sauce, a heavy dose of chiles, offal, and cured meats. Hit orders include crispy tamarind-glazed wings, grilled pork shoulder with lemongrass, and a fiery Lao papaya salad with eggplant. Over in Shaw, the space that formerly housed the team’s cocktail bar Hanumanh recently turned into a modern Southeast Asian eatery called Baan Mae. The more casual Laotian spot is known for [hosting chef pop-ups](https://www.baanmaedc.com/pop-up) and also serves [$15 bowls of noodles for brunch.](https://www.baanmaedc.com/menu) If you find yourself out in the suburbs, the family’s Northern Virginia staple Padaek recently [settled into a new Arlington home](/2023/5/10/23717540/thip-khao-family-announces-big-changes-to-its-lao-portfolio-this-spring).

**Price range:** $$

*The Washington Post* called Purple Patch [the 2023 Restaurant of the Year](https://www.washingtonpost.com/food/2023/10/02/purple-patch-dc-restaurant-of-the-year/) eight years after the Mount Pleasant spot debuted as one of D.C.’s first upscale local Filipino restaurants, now the institution is celebrating [10 years of feeding D.C. diners](https://www.instagram.com/p/DHKVrT9M39g/?hl=en). The sizzling, spicy pork belly and pork shoulder sisig remains a favorite dish, along with such staples as longanisa (sweet garlic sausage) and tocino (sweet grilled pork). There are also a surprising number of satisfying vegetarian dishes on the menu, with highlights like sweet and spicy calamansi tofu with pineapple fried rice and three different umami-packed vegetarian adobos (eggplant, cauliflower, or a seasonal mushroom and carrot). You also can’t leave without trying an ube-flavored dessert (which you can also snag from their shop upstairs) or the ube waffle with fried chicken marinated in soy sauce and vinegar at brunch. Chef and owner Patrice Cleary, who was born in the Philippines, also opened casual [Joia Burger](https://www.joiaburgerdc.com/) a block away [last year](/2024/3/6/24091958/inside-joia-mt-pleasant-new-burger-joint-filipino-dc-restaurant-openings), serving up wagyu beef smash burgers or housemade bean burgers with chopped toppings and ube soft serve.

Local hospitality vets Juan and Manuel Olivera granted [Adams Morgan a candle-lit getaway](/2023/10/30/23938792/inside-ceibo-adams-morgan-uruguay-dc-restaurant-openings) that pays homage to the brothers’ native Uruguay and its surrounding countries. Two-level Ceibo — the name refers to the flowering tree blooming at the bottom of the South American continent — captures the communal culture of asado, or preparing meats like beef, pork, and chorizo over an open flame. On the seafood side, highlights include oysters adorned with caviar farmed in Uruguay and Patagonian shrimp caught off the icy Atlantic coast of Argentina. Sweet potatoes, one of Uruguay’s biggest exports, play a prevalent part in the menu as savory starters, dessert, and inside drinks. A dimly lit downstairs bar spotlights South American wines, spirits, and other earthy ingredients and stays open until late on weekends. A popular Monday night sandwich pop-up full of Cubanos and Uruguay’s meaty chivitos (sliced steak) entered the fold this summer.

**Open for:** Dinner only

**Price range:** $$$

Chef Ryan Ratino’s buzzy bistro on lower 14th Street NW whips up dinners dreamed up by the ambitious chef, who’s among the youngest to have a restaurant earn a Michelin star. For spring, sample yellowtail crudo with shiso, cacio e pepe with taleggio and Pecorino, or its much-loved Amish chicken. The restaurant pushes boundaries everywhere: The menu incorporates a vintage French duck press gifted by gourmet supplier D’Artagnan into a theatrical tableside offering, while the bar program spearheaded by beverage director Will Patton is also not to miss. Chef’s tasting menus ($155) can be augmented with seasonal delicacies, and there’s now a la carte availability and abbreviated prix fixe options starting at $65. This fast-growing team, which is also behind two-Michelin-starred tasting room Jônt upstairs, is a 2025 [James Beard finalist for Best New Restaurant](/2025/4/2/24399667/james-beard-awards-finalists-dc-2025-restaurant-chef) ([Ômo by Jônt](https://elevenelevenpr-dot-yamm-track.appspot.com/2SRipCPKZYQGRD2-1r4EJqtq1Pkk-J8wtRe18AUcnC5ql6KuPlAGKGaSzo5FsgANMi80l-z1daZzhpeO--qkt74UZNhP436N5_remKzyE2ioZMk6vI8FVjsWWVwg6TDqflsaII7JZ_nUJinc4XMQNbuhPYMfcFN-7x9RY6w1_q_aVpcMAnw) in Winter Park, Florida).

**Price range:** $$

This family-run underground lounge landed in Dupont in spring 2022 with a star cast of Thai talent behind the wheel. Former sushi chef Billy Thammasathiti brings the heat with quail egg wontons, fiery papaya salads, boneless duck laap, and spicy beef or pork skewers, plus experimental orders like Parmesan-dusted egg noodles with tom yum herbs, bacon, and roasted chile jam or bite-sized calamari dressed with garlicky salt.

The 50-seat lair swings open at 4 p.m.

## Amparo Fondita

**Open for:** Dinner, plus Friday lunch and weekend brunch

**Price range:** $$

After years of searching for the right space, acclaimed chef and Oyamel alum Christian Irabién finally found a Dupont home for his long-awaited ode to modern Mexican cuisine and his roots. The Chihuahua, Mexico native, who grew up working in his grandfather’s Mexican restaurant in El Paso, seamlessly melds coastal flavors, seafood, and local seasonal ingredients, as in an expertly engineered salsa with ramps and a soft shell crab sandwich topped with red onion-habanero escabeche and green tomatoes. The constantly changing lineup may include a tropical big eye tuna ceviche surrounded with bright passionfruit and fresno; briny, mezcal-friendly oysters; and nixtamalized corn masa cakes topped with grilled pineapple.

**Must-try dish:** Anything slathered with mole negro (all-Oaxacan chiles, chocolate, and sea salt), which takes Irabién three days to perfect.

## Oyster Oyster

**Open for:** Dinner only

**Price range:** $$$

Chef Rob Rubba puts vegetables on a pedestal, so Oyster Oyster’s presence in Shaw is ideal for diners who don’t eat meat but still want to enjoy an avant-garde tasting menu with a Michelin star. Crowned Outstanding Chef [at the James Beard Awards](/2023/6/6/23750762/oyster-oyster-rob-rubba-james-beard-award-outstanding-chef-dc-2023) in 2023, Rubba first attracted D.C. critics’ attention as the former chef at Hazel and partnered with Estadio owner Max Kuller on this venture — which prioritizes sourcing from hyperlocal farms and mills. Think: a bird’s nest of fried celery root wrapped around a morsel of smoked tofu and shiitake chip cookie for dessert. The 28-seat Shaw dining room offers a vegetarian or vegan tasting menu ($135) and wine pairings ($85). The sustainably-minded restaurant also [won a Michelin green star](https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=66960X1516589&xs=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fguide.michelin.com%2Fus%2Fen%2Farticle%2Ffeatures%2Fwhat-is-a-michelin-green-star%3Fcjdata%3DMXxOfDB8WXww%26cjevent%3D8c6c4df9b6fa11ef82d108940a82b836%26utm_source%3Dcj%26utm_medium%3Dreferral%26utm_campaign%3DSkimlinks%26utm_content%3D100037205%26utm_term%3D15671072&referrer=eater.com&sref=https%3A%2F%2Fdc.eater.com%2Fmaps%2Fdc-michelin-stars-restaurants-mapped) in 2024 for its environmental and ethical practices, like re-using empty wine bottles as pressed plates.

## Shia

**Open for:** Dinner

**Price range:** $$$$

This [hidden Korean tasting menu spot](/2024/11/14/24295812/edward-lee-shia-korean-food-sustainability-union-market-dc-restaurant-openings) is actually a nonprofit restaurant from celebrity chef Edward Lee (who created pint-sized [Shia](/2024/11/14/24295812/edward-lee-shia-korean-food-sustainability-union-market-dc-restaurant-openings) late last year) where the team experiments with sustainable alternatives for restaurants. That means not using any plastic in the kitchen, firing up all-electric cookware, and making physical menus and coasters from leftover paper. The research in the kitchen hasn’t stopped the team from making cutting-edge Korean food in a prix fixe format that invites diners into the open kitchen, where they snack on first bites while chatting with chef de cuisine Max Chuvalas at the counter before diving into black sesame guksu (saucy cold noodles) topped with caviar, delicate seared black grouper with house-made fish cake, and a Korean mustard-glazed duck with umami-rich black garlic sauce. There are seven- ($185) and five-course ($100) options, plus a la carte snacks at the bar and $75 beverage pairings. Don’t skip out on the drinks, there are plenty of rare soju and sake options on the menu, along with Korean takes on classic cocktails like a toasted pine nut Old Fashioned.

**Know before you go**: The five-course menu is served in the front bar area, not in the open kitchen dining room, but you can ask for a peek into the cave-like kitchen during the shortened tasting.

## Tabard Inn

**Open for:** Lunch, dinner, weekend brunch

**Price range:** $$

D.C.’s century-old boutique hotel hideaway got a big 2023 glow-up full of French-Southern flair under culinary partner Ian Boden, the James Beard-nominated chef behind The Shack in Staunton, Virginia. Overseeing the fine-tuned changes in the charming Dupont dining room is executive chef Matthew Zafrir, a fine dining vet who honors his Maryland roots with memorable meals marked by mid-Atlantic ingredients. Highlights include crab fritters, local oysters doused in homemade hot sauce, honeynut squash, duck confit atop Carolina gold rice, and bone-in Berkshire pork chop with kohlrabi slaw. Zafrir’s close ties to family-run farm Earth N Eats also pay off on the plate, where wonderfully unique veggies show up morning to night (as do herbs plucked from Tabard’s outdoor garden). Swing by the eclectic bar up front on whiskey Wednesdays, when beverage director and Fabio Trabocchi alum Dominik Lenikowski pulls a rare bottle from the cellar to sip until it’s gone.

**Must-try dish:** Homemade doughnuts during brunch

Situated right next to the convention center since 2017, chef David Deshaies continues raise eyebrows by applying classic French technique to American-style diner food.

The hands-on chef is constantly in the kitchen, where the same 17th-century recipe for creme brulee, reportedly served to the brother of King Louis XIV, comes to fruition. Decked out in sleek wooden panels, dimly lit booths, and Parisian-styled murals, the date-night hot spot currently offers a four-course lobster tasting menu (in addition to a la carte).

Casa Teresa, García’s first solo venture, revives ancestral recipes of the culinary matriarchs he grew up around in Terrassa, Spain, and celebrates the time-honored cooking traditions of Basque Country and Catalonia through family-style feasts — think whole fish, local veggies, and pass-the-plate meats — all theatrically grilled over open flames and oak charcoal from a kitchen within diners’ view. The terracotta-toned dining room carves out space for a bar centered around gins, vermouth, and Spanish wines, plus an intimate “Teresa’s Table” that encourages chatty chef-guest interactions over tastings. A [Saturday brunch](https://www.sevenrooms.com/experiences/casateresa/brunch-the-spanish-way-11486168452) full of vermouth and family recipes entered the fold this spring.

**Must-try dish:** The How to Pa Amb Tomáquet is a fun dish that supplies diners with the crispy cristal bread, sliced tomatoes, and high-quality olive oil to build their own pan con tomate, plus a fun illustration card showing you how it’s done.

## Baan Siam

**Open for:** Lunch, dinner

**Price range:** $$

At this roomy Thai restaurant in Mt. Vernon Triangle, chef Jeeraporn Poksupthon has a kitchen worthy of her skill and ambition. Poksupthon led large catering kitchens in Thailand before she helped [usher a wave of chile-fueled Northern and Northeastern cooking into D.C. at now-closed Baan Thai in Logan Circle.](/2020/1/23/21078445/baan-thai-chef-opening-baan-siam-restaurant-mt-vernon-triangle-dc-spring-2020) At Baan Siam, she’s playing the hits — creamy, crunchy, and complex khao soi; tapioca skin dumplings with ground chicken, peanuts, and sweet fermented radish; and all sorts of spicy-sweet salads — while exploring sour-leaning dishes from her home country’s interior and ultra-hot curries from the South. Don’t forget to order mini griddled coconut milk pancakes and mango stick rice (when in season) for dessert.

**Price range:** $$

The team behind [critically acclaimed](/maps/dc-best-restaurants-38) [Daru](https://www.darudc.com/) doubled down on H Street in early 2025 with a vibrant new [South Indian restaurant and cocktail bar](/2025/2/25/24371678/tapori-funky-oasis-southeast-asian-street-food-h-street-dc-restaurant-openings). Tapori, which means “vagabond” in Hindi, centers around communal eating and flavors that span from Kerala to Nepal. Nepalese chef Suresh Sundas and beverage director Dante Datta teamed up with faraway chef Baburam Sharma to develop a menu that reflects his Nepalese background, upbringing in Delhi, and decades of experience in cooking South Indian cuisine. Dishes like pani puri, vada pav, dosas, and a clever “chop” riff on paneer join cocktails made with indigenous spices and fruits like chaat masala, jackfruit puree, and hibiscus.

The former home of Fancy Radish got a complete overhaul from Edit Lab, complete with a 20-person communal table, patchwork tile-covered bar, and booths peering into a bright open kitchen.

**Must-try dish:** The red-tinged Cauliflower 65 starter is a deep-fried favorite, dusted with roasted garlic, curry leaf, and mustard seed.

**Price range:** $$

Nearly a decade in, seven-time James Beard nominee chef Amy Brandwein’s polished osteria continues to shine in CityCenter DC. The five-time James Beard Award finalist goes all in on seasonal ingredients to construct a frequently changing Italian menu; that could mean melon-flanked snapper sashimi; peachy gazpacho; pristine pastas pumped up with purple broccoli and eggplant ragu; wood-fired mains like halibut and chanterelle mushrooms, lamb rib-eye, and pancetta-wrapped rabbit. Memorable desserts like an almond cake with fresh citrus, yuzu, and white chocolate come from Tonari alum and talented pastry chef Mary Mendoza. For something a little more casual (and affordable), consider Brandwein’s all-day sibling cafe [Piccolina](https://www.piccolinadc.com/) across the street.

Culinary couple Isabel Coss and Matt Conroy [opened Pascual last year in Capitol Hill with the Popal Group](/2024/2/14/24073013/inside-pascual-capitol-hill-daring-mexico-dc-restaurant-openings) and have been picking up accolades for the inventive Mexican spot ever since, including being named [one of Eater’s Best New Restaurants in America in 2024](https://www.eater.com/24282771/best-new-restaurants-america-2024). The hearth-focused menu honors Coss’s native Mexico City and the chefs’ combined experience working at top-tier Mexican restaurants. Smoked chicken and whole grilled fish shine on the seasonal menu, but vegetables are also given special treatment whether they’re roasted whole or fill the rotating selection of tamales. Oaxacan flavors are also present throughout the menu, with tlayudas topped with in-season vegetables and classic mole sauces in many dishes. Coss flexes her pastry muscles with must-try desserts, like the colossal cinnamon-dusted buñuelos that never leave the menu.

Ten years in, Spanish stalwart Ser continues to shine in its evolving Ballston neighborhood.

Other standouts include crab-topped lobster from the raw bar, gorgeous seasonal salads, and gazpacho when summer calls. Its Spanish co-owner Javier Candon infuses his own spirits, as seen in Ser’s superior gin and tonic.

An a la carte menu joins a new five-course “Sofra” menu ($145) that’s a surprise on the plate every night, plus $65-$95 beverage pairings. For something more affordable, head to sibling cafe Yellow, [which expanded to Georgetown](/2022/6/15/23170052/michelin-rated-albi-sibling-cafe-georgetown) with [fiery pies at night](/2023/9/22/23884600/acclaimed-levantine-cafe-yellow-dinner-georgetown-michael-rafidi), and added a Union Market locale [with lively Levantine bar La’ Shukran up top](/2024/9/18/24248481/inside-la-shukran-dc-funky-levantine-cocktail-bar-dc-openings).

**Best for:** Date night, larger groups, an arak cocktail, and everything in between

## Shilling Canning Company

**Open for:** Dinner and weekend brunch

**Price range:** $$

Chef Reid Shilling puts mid-Atlantic ingredients on a pedestal at his 5-year-old Navy Yard restaurant and raw bar, devoting an entire menu page to credit the dairy, oyster, cattle, and produce purveyors helping build his seasonal dishes at any given time. A seven-course tasting option gives diners a front-row seat of the wood-burning action, with a la carte available too. Highlights include Chesapeake rockfish with Karma Farm carrots, squash blossoms dressed with basil from Shilling’s own on-site garden, and Autumn Olive pork rib-eye sweetened up with honey-poached apricots from Ridgeview Farms. Shilling puts his preservation skills on full display in clear glass jars around the dining room, and bobbing blueberries or blackberries may make their way into a dreamy dessert on any given night.

**Fun fact:** [Fancy Ranch](https://www.fancyranchdc.com/), the team’s Amish chicken pop-up in Union Market, will be replaced with a surprise new oyster one soon.

## Mama Chang

**Open for:** Lunch and dinner

**Price range:** $$

The “home-style” Chinese restaurant in Peter Chang’s portfolio pays tribute to the women that influenced the legendary former embassy chef, with fiery dishes that call back his childhood in the Hubei province of central China and his home life in Virginia. Chang, a master of numbing spice, has woven Sichuan and Hunan techniques into a menu of vegetable-heavy plates, dim sum, and family-style orders. And there’s more to like in Chang’s sprawling empire: There’s dine-in seating across its plant-filled, zen [dining room](/2019/2/27/18243222/mama-chang-eater-inside-fairfax) in Fairfax. The famed Chinese chef planted roots in Dupont Circle [with the opening of Chang Chang](/2022/10/4/23387771/sichuan-peter-chang-chang-chang-dc-restaurant-openings-dupont), his first-ever D.C. restaurant with a [supersized menu](/2023/9/26/23890863/chef-peter-chang-dc-menu-chang-chang-dupont-coming-soon). The latest namesake spot (his 19th restaurant to date) is coming to Alexandria, following up 2024 NoVa openings in Herndon and [NiHao in National Landing.](/2024/5/9/24153007/arlington-national-landing-new-nihao-chinese-peter-chang-dc-restaurant-openings)

**Must-try dish:** Scallion bubble pancakes
